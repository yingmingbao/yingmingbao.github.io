# "CORPORATE STRATEGY," Ansoff, 1965

- Preface

THIS, book is concerned with business strategy formulation in the social-economic environment .of the United States.

This book is concerned with management, the active process of determining and guiding the course of a firm toward its objectives.

defn
## the interest is normative: we seek to develop a practically useful series of concepts and procedures which managers can use to manage.

Management of a business firm is a very large complex of activities which consists of analysis, decisions, communication, leadership, motivation, measurement, and control.

defn
## we single out the process of decision making, since it is the comer, ' stone of successful management. Peter Drucker has said, 'The 'end-products of ... management are decisions and actions.'

Our interest is in the characteristics' of these decisions, regardless of the organizational process by which they are made:

Our .interest is in a particular part of the total 'space' of decisions which confronts a business manager. These are the strategic decisions.

In viewing the problem of strategic decisions the approach is analytic.

Historical progress has been from the 'inside out'. Taylor, Mayo, and their generation concerned themselves with problems of individual and group productivity within the manufacturing organization.

Post-war efforts have spread to a wide range of internal operating problems of the firm.

Analytic approaches to the external or strategic problems of the firm have come last.

Finally, we have attempted to make the analytic framework practical.

This calls for a compromise between mathematical precision on the one hand and realism in the problem statement on the other. The compromise is consistently made in favour of the latter.

Methodologically, the 'scientific' method of operations research and management science is not wholly applicable to the strategic problem.

the method falls short in several important respects.

In summary, this book provides a practical method for strategic decision making within a business firm.

## CHAPTER 1. Structure of Business Decisions

### THE PROBLEM

a major part of a manager's time is occupied in a daily process of making numerous and diverse decisions.

decisions of great potential import come mixed with trivial but time-consuming demands; the nature of decisions is multifaceted and continually variable.

In seeking to .understand this very complex decision process we can proceed along two complementary lines.

The first, and by far the more ambitious one, is to discover how people in general and executives in particular, make decisions, either individually or in groups.

This direction, which goes under the general name of decision theory, has received much attention for many years from diverse scientific disciplines: philosophy, psychology, mathematics, and economics.

The other direction is to study the alternatives and their consequences to seek an understanding of the nature and the structure of decisions

This is a somewhat less ambitious task, for it does not attempt to penetrate the decision maker's mind.

it seeks to study the nature of his job and thus improve decision making through improving his insights into the antecedents and the consequences of major decisions.

Instead of studying the mind of the manager, this approach explores the business firm.

the so-called microeconomic theory of the firm, which occupies much of the economists' thought and attention, sheds relatively little. light on decision-making processes in a real-world firm.

Cyert and March. They have formulated a behavioral theory of the firm 2 which combines economic analysis with social behavior and is addressed explicitly to business decisions within a firm.

the class of decisions studied by them is limited and different from the class of interest to us, namely, strategic decisions.

Since there is no adequate theory of the strategic decision process, we have to start by constructing our own model of the firm.

The purpose of this chapter is first to outline such a model and then' to single !Jut the principal classes of business decisions.

Following this we shall discuss some special characteristics of one of these classes -the strategic decisions -which is the core subject of this book.

## - CLASSES OF DECISIONS
  
The adjective' business' has traditionally meant that the firm is an economically or 'money' motivated purposive social organization.

defn
Traditionally the measure of success in a business firm has been profit -the excess of returns to the firm over the costs incurred -and it is this measure that has distinguished a business firm to other forms of social organization such as the government, the church, the armed forces, nonprofitmaking foundations, etc.

the role of profitability as the corner stone of business has recently been subjected to sharp questioning.

.for the purpose of discussing business decisions we need only what mathematicians would call a 'weak~ assumption, namely, that, however measured and however variable, a set of objectives can be ascribed to each firm, and that this set is the major guidepost in the decision process.

The second major characteristic which is essential to an understanding of decision making is that a firm seeks its objectives through the medium of profit and, more specifically, through conversion of its resources into goods and/or services and then obtaining a return on these by selling them to customers.

There· are three types of basic resources: physical (inventory, plant), monetary (money, credit), and human.

All three are used up in the conversion process:

survival of the firm depends on profit; unless profits are generated and used for replacement of resources, the firm will eventually run down.

From a decision viewpoint the overall problem of the business of the firm is to configure and direct the resource-conversion process in such way as to optimize the attainment of the objectives.

Since this calls for a great many distinct and different decisions, a study of the overall decision process can be facilitated by dividing the total decision 'space' into several distinct categories.

Our approach will be to construct three categories called respectively strategic, administrative, and operating, each related to a different aspect of the resource-conversion process.

Operating decisions usually absorb the bulk of the firm's energy and attention. The object is to maximize the efficiency of the firm's resource-conversion process, or, in more conventional language, to maximize profitability of current operations.

defn
## The major decision areas are resource allocation (budgeting) among functional areas and product lines, scheduling of operations, supervision of performance, and applying control actions.

The key decisions involve pricing, establishing marketing strategy, setting production schedules and inventory levels, and deciding on relative expenditures in support of R&D (research and development), marketing, and operations.

Strategic decisions [a] are primarily concerned with external, rather than internal, problems of the firm and specifically with selection of the product-mix which the firm will produce and the markets to which it will sell.

defn
it is the problem of deciding what business the firm is in and what kinds of businesses it will seek to enter.

defn
A very important feature of the overall business decision process becomes accentuated in the strategic problem.

a large majority of decisions must be made within the framework of a limited total resource.

Administrative decisions are concerned with structuring the firm's resources in a way which creates a maximum performance potential.'

defn
One part of the administrative problem is concerned with organization: structuring of authority and responsibility relationships, work flows, information flows, distribution channels, and location of facilities.

The other part is concerned with acquisition and development of resources:' development of raw material sources, personnel training and development, financing, and acquisition of facilities and equipment.

- INTERACTIONS AMONG DECISION CLASSES
The characteristics of the three classes of decisions are summarized in Table 1.1.

While distinct, the decisions are interdependent and complementary.

In this sense 'structure follows strategy' -product-market characteristics create operating needs, and these, in tum, determine the structure of authority, responsibility, work flows, and information flows within the firm:

As the country's economy developed, different strategic opportunities became available to business.

As firms took advantage of these opportunities and thus changed their previous strategies, operating inadequacies developed which dictated new forms of organization.

Alfred P. Sloan in his memoirs4 has diagnosed one of the major requirements which strategy has imposed on structure: to organize the firm's management in a way which assures a proper balance of attention between the strategic and operating decisions.

Such balance is difficult to achieve.

Problems are automatically generated at all levels of management,

The volume of such decisions is great and constant, particularly because of the need for daily supervision and control.

By contrast, strategic decisions are not self-regenerative; they make no automatic claims on top management attention.

- Note Loc. 169  | Added on Monday, January 19, 2015, 09:45 AM the previous quotes were about operating problems.

Unless actively pursued, they may remain hidden behind the operations problems.

Firms are generally very slow in recognizing conditions under which concern with the operating problem must give way to a concern with the strategic.

The immediate demands on management time and effort raised by such operating problems can readily obscure the fact that the basic ills lie not in the firm but in its environment.

a natural tendency is to seek remedies in operational improvements:

Since strategic problems are harder to pinpoint, they require special attention.

Unless specific provisions are made for .concern with strategy, the firm may misplace its effort in pursuit of operating efficiency at times when attention to strategic opportunities (or threats) can produce a more radical and immediate improvement in the firm's performance.

Two kinds of provisions are required.

One is to provide an administrative environment in which a proper balance of management attention can be maintained. This is the main subject of Chandler's book.

The other is to provide management with a method of analysis which is focused on the search for strategic decision needs and opportunities.

This feature is the cornerstone of the problem-solving method which we shall develop in this book.

a comprehensive theory of decision making within a firm must include the interactions among the major classes of decisions.

As a first step toward a unified theory, partial theories of the respective operating, administrative, and strategic decision classes must be understood.

Cyert and March have made an important contribution to study of the first class; Chandler's work sheds important light on the second.

Our purpose in this book is to construct a practical framework for the third.

As a step toward a unified theory the final chapter of this book will discuss the role of strategy within the overall structure of decisions.

## CHAPTER 2. A Model for Strategic Decisions

- THE PROBLEM
THE end product of strategic decisions is deceptively simple; a combination of products and markets is selected for the firm.

The change from previous posture requires a redistribution of the firm's resources

At first glance, strategic decisions resemble capital-investment decisions, which deal in a similar manner with resource allocation to fixed assets and machinery.

This analysis will show that the resemblance is more superficial than real and that the differences between the two types of decisions are so great as to require new concepts and methodology of the strategic problem.

- CAPITAL INVESTMENT THEORY (CIT)
Capital investment analysis starts with. identification and enumeration of fixed asset and equipment proposals for the next budget period.

For each proposal, positive (revenues) and negative (costs) cash flows are computed over the life-time of the project.

For proper comparison, these flows must be marginal to the other flows within the firm: only additional revenues and costs generated by the project must be considered.

It is essential to the traditional capital investment theory that all of the projects which will become available during the forthcoming budget period be anticipated at decision time.

With the projects enumerated and the flows determined, the worth of each project is evaluated with respect to both its net returns to the firm and the entailed risk.

Three common methods for evaluation are the payback period, the internal rate of discount, and the net present worth.

With individual evaluations in hand, the preferred projects can be chosen by several techniques such as minimum rate of discount for relatively simple problems, and linear programming for more complex ones.

At first glance, this procedure for plant and equipment decisions appears applicable to deciding what markets to enter or what products to develop.

Our objective in this  is to see where product-market investments differ from capital investments and what modifications in the method are needed for a practical approach to strategic decisions.

- STEPS IN PROBLEM SOLVING
Simon has shown [7] that solution of any decision problem in business, science, or art can be viewed in four steps.

1. Perception of decision need or opportunity. Simon calls this the intelligence phase.
2. Formulation of alternative courses of action.
3. Evaluation of the alternatives for their respective contributions.
4. Choice of one or more alternatives for implementation.
capital investment theory is concerned with the last two steps, evaluation and choice.

1. Perception of Need.

perception of need is a major issue in. strategic decision making.

A method which fails to provide for the choice between continuing concern with the operating problem as against attention to the strategic, leaves a key part of the problem to intuition and judgment.

Our requirement is for a method which provides for continuing intelligence activity and for diagnosis of the need for strategic action.

2. Search for Alternatives.

Traditional capital investment theory requires that all of the alternatives be known at decision time. In the strategic problem this is a rare situation.

In strategic decisions such conditions of partial ignorance about future opportunities are the rule rather than the exception; a method which fails to provide for them is not addressed to a business firm.

Under conditions of partial ignorance a firm is confronted with two problems.

The first is how to conduct an active search for attractive opportunities.

The second problem is to allocate the firm's limited resources among the opportunities which have been uncovered and the possibly more attractive ones which are just around the corner'.

A practical method for strategic decisions must, therefore, broaden this theory by adding provisions for search and for project evaluation under partial ignorance.

3. Project Evaluation.

CIT uses long-term profitability over the lifetime of the project as the yardstick for evaluation.

Efforts to apply such a single yardstick to the strategic problem run into theoretical as well as practical difficulties.

On the conceptual level, viewpoints have been advanced by business writers and economists that profit is not the sole objective of a business firm and that a 'vector' of objectives, only one of whose components is profit, should be used.

usually composed of conflicting objectives; when the firm's performance is optimized on one, it is degraded on others.

CIT which uses the single yardstick is not equipped to handle either the multiplicity of objectives or the problem of conflict between them.

- Note Loc. 299  | Added on Tuesday, January 20, 2015, 05:55 AM looking a life through a straw...
On the practical level it turns out that, even for the profitability component of the vector, attempts to compute cash flows for long-lived projects are frustrated by the rapid decrease in reliability of data for long-term forecasts.

capital investment theory turns out to be least reliable in a most important situation.

limitations of data usualIy lead to cash flows which are typical of a product-market area, not ones that are specific for the opportunities in question.

what the firm needs is not typical but particular flows which will reflect the unique competitive advantages of the product-market opportunity, such as superior quality, timing of product introduction, customer appeal, and competitors' reactions.

A related and equally important difficulty is encountered in efforts to make project projections marginal to other projects in the firm's product-market posture.

This requires that cash projections take account of the joint economies

joint effects are just as difficult to reduce to pounds as uniqueness is; the task becomes prohibitive for' breakthrough' types of product.

- Note Loc. 312  | Added on Tuesday, January 20, 2015, 05:58 AM i like the phrase 'joint effects'
proper use of joint effects and of unique characteristics are primary competitive tools in a firm which aspires to be a better-than-average business competitor.

Again CIT assumes that joint effects will be taken care of outside the method.

- REQUIREMENTS AND BACKGROUND FOR THE NEW METHOD
capital investment theory must be broadened, amended, and supplemented.

It must be broadened to monitor the business environment and to search for new product-market entries under conditions of partial ignorance.

It must be amended to deal with multiple conflicting objectives.

It must be supplemented to identify unique product market opportunities and joint effects.

The method must:

1. Include all four, rather than the last two, steps of the generalized problem-solving sequence.

2. Handle allocation of the firm's "resources between opportunities in hand and probable future opportunities under conditions of partial ignorance.

3. Evaluate joint effects (synergy) resulting from addition of new product-markets to the firm.

4. Single out opportunities with outstanding competitive advantages.

5. Handle a vector of potentially antagonistic objectives.

6. Evaluate the long-term potential of projects even though cash-flow projections are unreliable.

business managers began to develop practical approaches which bore little resemblance to CIT project evaluation schemes

A talented and prophetic Frenchman; Henri Fayol, [21] anticipated imaginatively and soundly most of the more recent analyses of modem business practice.

Recently three .important books have taken a view of the business firm which is closely related to our present interest.

Within a historical perspective Chandler [22] has analyzed the relationship among the firm's environment, its business strategy, and its organizational structure.

Sloan [23] has presented a highly illuminating history of some forty years of strategy formulation and implementation in the world's largest firm.

Cyert and March [24] made a major step toward development of a theory of the firm from the decision maker's point of view.

- Note Loc. 341  | Added on Tuesday, January 20, 2015, 06:03 AM read these bools
these three efforts complement one another, since each concerns itself with a different aspect of the' total decision problem.

Chandler's primary interest is in the administrative problem and its relationship to the strategic.

Cyert and March concern themselves exclusively with the operating problem; their firm keeps its organization intact and its product-market posture constant.

the' present book takes a comprehensive view of the strategic problem with only a minor aside to the administrative problem.

- In the area of methodology our debt is to three primary sources.

The first goes back to the results of many years of thought and. study in the United States military services which have led to the development of a doctrine and methodology [25] of military decision making.

The second, more recent source is the business world.

some publications on methodology [26, 27].
The third source of methodological insight is the work of H. A. Simon and A. Newell. [28, 29]

they have developed a general methodology for problem solving which focuses on the phases of intelligence and, search, thus providing a means for attacking business problems in which these two phases are also of primary importance.

Reitman [30] has restated Simon's formulation in somewhat broader terms which have a direct application to the strategic decision problem.

In summary, both the conceptual foundation and tools of methodology are now at hand for an attempt at a comprehensive 'strategic decision theory of the firm ... which will meet the requirements for a practical, normative method stated earlier in this section.

- Note Loc. 358  | Added on Tuesday, January 20, 2015, 06:07 AM important... Ansoff is proposing a Comprehensive Straegic Decision Theory of the firm

- STRUCTURE OF THE NEW METHOD
As an alternative frame of reference to capital investment theory we could have used portfolio selection theory.

portfolio selection concerns selecting securities, either for an individual investor or for an investment firm.

H. Markowitz [31] has written the definitive work on portfolio selection.

a more recent approach taken by Clarkson [32] has many features in common with the present problem.

Clarkson's formulation is significant to this 'discussion, because it sheds light on yet another requirement which .is not even suggested by capital investment theory.

the decision rules for search and evaluation of products and markets are not the same for all firms.

the decision rules for product-market selection vary from firm to firm and within a firm, from one time period to another:-This

Since objectives are no longer a simple yardstick, they will vary from one type of firm to another depending on the firm's past profitability, its prospects, and its stage in the life, cycle.

The fact that decision rules vary is the foundation' for our approach to the problem.

- Note Loc. 378  | Added on Tuesday, January 20, 2015, 06:10 AM the objectives vector is dynamic...
Our concern .must be not only with evaluation of projects for given rules, which is the main concern of CIT, but also with formulation of the rules for each individual, firm.

the focus of interest is on the formulation aspect.

formulation of decision rules requires a novel approach. Formulation of rules plays a determining role in the overall process because, as Simon 'has shown [33] it tends to predetermine the final choice of the individual product-markets.

We shall deal with the strategic problems on two levels and in two steps.

On the first level we shall consider the characteristics of the firm's total position, to derive decision rules for search and evaluation of opportunities.

deciding what kind of business the firm is in and what kind of business it should be in.

Two decision rules in their totality describe this concept.

One, which sets the yardsticks for the firm's performance, deals with the objectives of the firm.

The other, which defines the desirable characteristics of products and markets, deals with the product-market strategy.

The two sets of rules have a means-ends relationship; objectives set the goals, and strategy sets the path to the goals.

On the second level the rules are applied to individual opportunities whenever they occur and however they come about.

- OUTLINE OF THE ADAPTIVE SEARCH METHOD FOR STRATEGY FORMULATION
the method uses a search procedure in arriving at a strategy.

This is accomplished through a 'cascade' approach: at the outset possible decision rules are formulated in gross terms and are then successively refined through several stages as the solution proceeds.

This gives the appearance of solving the problem several times over, but with successively more precise results.

The first step is to decide between the two major alternatives: to diversify or not to diversify the firm.

The second step is to choose a broad product-market scope for the firm from a list of broad industrial categories.

The third is to refine the scope in terms of characteristics or product-markets within it.

Another important characteristic of this process is feedback.

Since the cascade is a process of search for the best solution, information may develop at later stages which casts doubt on previous decisions.

The procedure within each step of the cascade is similar.

1. A set of objectives is established.

2. The difference (the' gap ') between the current position of the 'firm and the objectives is estimated.

3. One, or more courses of action (strategy) is proposed.

4. These are tested for their' gap-reducing properties'.

A course is accepted if it substantially closes the gap;, if it does not, new alternatives are tried.

the method has what Reitman [35] calls 'open constraint' property; both the objectives and the evaluation of the present position are subject to revision as a result of insights obtained in the process of solution.

To summarize briefly, the adaptive search method was described above in its application to formulation of a product market strategy for a business firm.

Its salient characteristics are a ‘cascade' procedure of successive narrowing and refining the· decision rules, 2. feed-back between stages in the cascade, 3.a gap-reduction process within each stage: and 4. adaptation of both objectives and starting-point evaluation.

The concepts of strategy and of objectives are the keys to successful application of the method.

the next few s will explore how product-market decisions relate to these concepts in practice.

a decision flow diagram will be constructed which applies the adaptive search method to the problem in hand.

This schematic is shown in Figure 2.1, where for simplicity all feedback relations have been omitted.

Figure 2.1. Decision schematic in strategy formulation. [SEE PAPER FOR FIGURE]

## CHAPTER 3. Objectives
- THE PROBLEM
we described a business firm as a purposive organization whose behavior is directed toward identifiable end purposes or objectives.

When made explicit within the firm, 'objectives become tools' of many ,uses in appraisal of performance, control, coordination, as well as all phases of the decision process.

objectives have been used as a basis for an integrated view on the entire management process which has become known as 'management by objectives '.[41]

Our interest in this book is in only one of these uses, namely, the role which objectives play in strategic decisions.

shall not deal with the very important problem of the organizational hierarchy of objectives which are essential to the operating problem of the firm.

Nor shall we be concerned with the process by which objectives are derived, whether they are imposed from above by top management, generated through a synthesis of lower-level objectives, or arrived at through a bargaining process among participants in the firm.

We shall, however, be concerned with the business, economic, and social variables which determine the objectives, regardless of the process by which they are formulated..

The central question, which must be resolved before specific values are assigned, is what kind of objectives should the firm seek: maximum profit, maximum value of stockholders' equity, or, a balanced satisfaction of its 'stockholders'.

One way to an answer is through philosophy -a study of ethical, aesthetic, and. economic values within the firm and the socioeconomic-political environment.

Another way to the answer is through a historical analysis of business objectives that have been used and how they have evolved.

A third approach is to construct a system of objectives which is consistent.and usable on one hand, and which can be related to current business practice on the other.

This is the approach we shall use in this chapter.

As the first step, this chapter is devoted. to laying foundations.

Several currently popular philosophies of objectives will be described and compared, a new philosophy will be formulated, and the central business objective will be described.

- CURRENT PHILOSOPHIES
Traditionally and historically, a business firm has been regarded as an economic institution; it. has developed a measurement of efficiency -profit -which is common and unique to business.

It would seem, therefore, that profit-seeking, or maximization of profit would be the natural, single business objective.

Distinguished writers have sought to remove profit from its position as the central motive in business and replace it with doctrines such a~~equal responsibility to stockholders, long-term survival, or a negotiated consensus among various participants in the firm.

Some have branded profit as immoral and socially unacceptable. [44]

Several reasons can be advanced for this confused state of affairs.

The first is the growing conflict between long-and short-term demands for the firm's resources.

During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, before technology made necessary long-term, product research and long-term anticipation of capital-equipment needs, it seemed appropriate to use short-term profitability as a yardstick of the firm's success.

Increasingly in the twentieth century, and more rapidly after World War II, the influx of technology and increasing capital-equipment needs have forced concern with long-term problems.

if short-term profitability were to remain the principal performance yardstick; investments in projects with long-term maturity would naturally be neglected. The result would be a threat to the very survival of the firm in' the long run.

To assure survival, the concept of the firm's objectives must be expanded to cover the long-term horizon.

The rnicro-economic theory of the firm, a major body of theory which gave rise to the nineteenth-century concept of profit maximization -could not accommodate this expansion for two reasons.

First, because it is basically a steady-state theory concerned with successive equilibrium conditions and thus not capable of dealing with distinctions between short-and long-range horizons;

·secondly, because it does not recognize the exchange between investments for current profit and those [or future returns. [46]

In recent years a number of economists and business writers have offered alternatives to short-term profit maximization such as maximization of the company's net present worth, [47] maximization of market value of the firm, [48] or profit-constrained maximization of growth. [49]

A sharp break with the profit maximization tradition was made by Drucker, who proposed survival as the central purpose of the firm.

This is to be accomplished through pursuit of a set of 'survival objectives' based on five' survival functions' which the firm must fulfil to stay alive.

according to Drucker, ' "profit maximization" is the wrong concept whether it be interpreted to mean short-range or long-range profits'. [50]

In reaction to the public outrages at the 'smash-n-grab imperialism ' of the nineteenth century, business has acquired a sense of social responsibility to society in general and participants in the firm in particular.

Frank Abrams' speaks of the firm's responsibility to 'maintain an equitable and working balance among the claims of the various directly interested groups stockholders, employees, customers, and the public at large'. [51]

'responsibilities' and 'objectives’, are not synonymous, they have been made one in a 'stakeholder theory' of objectives.

the firm should be derived by balancing the conflicting claims of the various' stakeholders' in the firm: managers, workers, stockholders, suppliers, vendors.

The firm has a responsibility to all of these and must configure its objectives so as to give each a measure of satisfaction.

The philosophy of objectives has been further complicated by structural changes within the firm.

a major shift from ownership by a few individuals to ownership by many small shareholders: It created professional management cadres, working for a salary, virtually' in control of the firm's fortunes, and guided by personal ambitions of their own.

The objectives of top management can and frequently do come in conflict with objectives of other stakeholders,-in the firm and in particular with those of the equity owners.

Another structural change in the firm has been growth in size and complexity.

The resulting philosophy of decentralized profit and loss responsibility, which in America culminated in the 1920s in the doctrine of centralized policy-making with decentralized operations control, has led to a wide delegation of decision making power in the firm. [54]

Thus the decision process now consists of many local decisions which are based on local limited information and are in potential conflict with one another.

Somehow these add up to consensus decisions on central issues of the firm.

This change has dealt a severe blow not only to the economist's concept of profit maximization .but also to the validity of the micro economic theory in explaining behavior of the firm.

While the managerialists have offered a number of substitute explanations of the behavior of the firm, until recently none has produced a practical guide to business decisions. [55]

substantial progress toward this end has been made by Ceyert and March in A Behavioral Theory of the Firm. [56]

they argue that 'organizations' do not have objectives, only people' have objectives'. Therefore, the objectives of a firm are in reality a negotiated consensus of objectives of the influential participants.

Cyert and March suggest that the consensus is negotiated by the participants and is renegotiated as it becomes unstable because of changes in power position or in outside business conditions.

The great value of the Cyert and March theory lies in the fact that it offers for the first, time a common framework for the economic and the managerialist points of view by admitting both economic and social variables into the decision-making process.

- Note Loc. 526  | Added on Wednesday, January 21, 2015, 05:47 AM important
the discussion is limited to the operating rather than the strategic problem of the firm.

Cyert and March have described the general characteristics of the negotiation process which takes place in forming objectives, they have not yet succeeded in showing how specific objectives evolve within the firm.

- BASIS FOR A PRACTICAL SYSTEM OF OBJECTIVES
The management responsible -the board, the corporate management, and the key operating managers -will have to arrive at a consensus within the present power structure of the firm.

However, once this -is done, it will be found that most of the conflicting systems of objectives have not been related.by their proponents to the system of performance measurements which currently exists within business firms.

Objectives need to be made compatible with the existing information-processing systems within the firm.

we shall develop in this and the following chapter a system of objectives which is based on the following premises.

1. The firm has both (a) 'economic' objectives aimed at optimizing the efficiency of its total resource-conversion process and (b) 'social' or non-economic objectives, which are the result of interaction among individual objectives of the firm's participants.

2. In most firms the economic objectives exert the primary influence on the firm's behavior and form the main body of explicit goals used by management for guidance and control of the firm.

3. The central purpose of the firm is to maximize long-term return on resources employed within the firm.

4. The social objectives exert a secondary modifying and constraining influence on management behavior.

5. In addition to proper objectives two related types of influence are exerted on management behavior responsibilities and constraints. [58]

a. Objectives are decision rules which enable management to guide and measure the firm's performance toward its purpose.

b. Responsibilities are obligations which the firm undertakes to discharge. They do not form a part of the firm's internal guidance, and control mechanism.

- Note Loc. 556  | Added on Wednesday, January 21, 2015, 05:52 AM this is important... ties goals to metrics at a level higher tham metrics.

c. Constraints are decision rules which exclude certain options from the firm's freedom actions.

our basic philosophy can be viewed as an attempt to reconcile several of the points of view.'

The benefit of the doubt is given clearly to the' traditionalist' approach of the economist, but with the addition of a long-term view of profitability. At the same time, the 'managerial' influence is admitted as a modifier to the final system of objectives.

we have the benefit of a clear relationship between objectives and common business performance measurements.

- BASIC ECONOMIC OBJECTIVE
Contrary to the assumption of Cyert and March, we assume that the business firm does have objectives which are.. different and 'distinct from' individual' objectives of the participants.

objectives for an institution known as a business firm can be inferred from its relationship to the environment, from its internal structure, from the functions it performs, and from its past history.

This does not lead to the conclusion that objectives of all firms are identical, but rather, as we shall see, to a conclusion that they are drawn from the same master list.

Our second major assumption is that the firm seeks to optimize the efficiency of its resource-conversion process-:-The

To make this concept meaningful, we 'need the idea of the time horizon of a firm -the period over which the firm seeks to optimize its resource-conversion efficiency.

Most large publicly held corporations are legally and practically assumed to exist in perpetuity, i.e. their time horizon is infinite. There are many cases of smaller and closely held firms where the time horizon is finite.

We define an objective as a measure of efficiency of the resource-conversion process. An objective contains three elements: the particular attribute that is chosen as a measure of efficiency, the yardstick, or scale, by which the attribute is measured, and the goal -the particular value on the scale which the firm seeks to attain.

defn
The key idea is selecting profitability (a measure 'of return on resources) rather than profit (excess of revenues over cost) for the principal attribute.

The second distinctive point in our formulation of objectives is selection of the rate of return on the investment as the yardstick of profitability.

## CHAPTER 4. A Practical System of Objectives
- THE PROBLEM
WE shall approach practical objectives through a: series, of approximations.

Keeping the maximization of the rate of return as the central theoretical objective, we shall develop a number of subsidiary objectives (which the economists call proxy variables) which contribute in different ways to improvement in the return and which are also measurable in business practice.

the difficulties of long-term 'maximization are replaced by the problem of' reconciling claims of conflicting objectives.

- PROXIMATE OBJECTIVE AND PARTIAL IGNORANCE
The first step is to deal with the problem of the time horizon.

For most firms this will be very distant, theoretically at infinity. In contrast, the period for which reasonably reliable profitability forecasts can be constructed is relatively short and varies l:;>etween three and' ten years.

When taken beyond five years, most profit forecasts become unreliable because of a great many uncertainties in the future state of technology, the company's share of the market, future management skills, general economic climate, and .political climate.

We shall refer to the period for which the firm is able to construct forecasts with an accuracy of, say, plus or minus 20 per cent as the planning horizon of the firm.

This divides the firm's time horizon into two parts: what we shall call the proximate period (three to ten years) which extends to the planning horizon, and the long-term period from the planning to the time horizon. The· latter may be very long indeed.

Within the proximate period, data are adequate for direct measurement of return on investment. There is no need, therefore, for proxy objectives.

The question of relative risk of different opportunities is of great importance. Since R OI is what is usually called an expected value measure (it uses probable values of contributing variables) it does not discriminate between risky opportunities and less risky ones.

theory has produced very few useful insights for dealing with risk.

for practical purposes we suggest that, following customary practice, the firm establish three levels for ROI, each adjusted to the relative· riskiness of opportunities.

The reference level is the value of the ROI which will be determined as the proximate objective by methods which will be presently discussed.

A high level of desired ROI is then set up for opportunities which are judged to be very risky, and a correspondingly low level of acceptable profitability for opportunities which are a near 'sure thing'.

The next issue is how to select the reference level for ROI.

How should a firm go about establishing realistic ROI levels so that it does not end up regretting early over commitment of resources on the one hand, or having been overly 'stingy' on the other?

Peter Drucker has diagnosed the problem in more general terms as follows: 'We cannot rest content with developing plans for the events which we either foresee or want to foresee. We must prepare for all possible and a good many impossible contingencies. We must have a workable solution or at least the approach to it -for anything that may come up. [61]

The resolution of this 'bird in hand versus two in the bush' dilemma is helped by the fact that, as was indicated earlier, the ignorance about future opportunities is not total but partial.

While many individual products, customers, or company acquisitions cannot be specified in advance, the characteristics of the industries in which these will occur, the probability of their occurrence, and their general characteristics can.

One way to use this information is first to estimate the average expected ROI for industries in which the firm is interested and also the ROI for outstanding and for below-average opportunities.

Next, a range of values of ROI is selected for the reference risk class.

The value at the high end of the range represents a highly desirable goat, the value at the low end the acceptance threshold below which opportunities are not accepted.

The goal-threshold values are based on the following factors:

1. Past, present, and future ROI characteristics of the industries in which the firm is interested, including the average and the spread,

2. An estimate of the number of opportunities which the firm may encounter during the next budget period.

3. The urgency of strategic action by the firm during the forthcoming budget period.

Objectives need to be made compatible with the existing information-processing systems within the firm.

a system of objectives which is based on the following premises. .

1. The firm has both (a) 'economic' objectives aimed at optimizing the efficiency of its total resource-conversion process and (b) 'social' or non-economic objectives, which are the result of interaction among individual objectives of the firm's participants.

2. In most firms the economic objectives exert the primary influence on the firm's behavior and form the main body of explicit goals used by management for guidance and control of the firm.

3. The central purpose of the firm is to maximize long-term return on resources employed within the firm.

4. The social objectives exert a secondary modifying and constraining influence on management behavior.

5. In addition to proper objectives two related types of influence are exerted on management behavior responsibilities and constraints. [58]

a. Objectives are decision rules which enable management to guide and measure the firm's performance toward its purpose.

b. Responsibilities are obligations which the firm undertakes to discharge.

c. Constraints are decision rules which exclude certain options from the firm's freedom actions.

our basic philosophy can be viewed as an attempt to reconcile several of the points of view.'

we have the benefit of a clear relationship between objectives and common business performance measurements.

The goal-threshold values are based on the following factors:

1. Past, present, and future ROI characteristics of the industries in which the firm is interested, including the average and the spread, as described above.

2. An estimate of the number of opportunities which the firm may encounter during the next budget period.

3. The urgency of strategic action by the firm during the forthcoming budget period.

4. The amount of resource (or the size of the entry) which the firm wants to commit to product-market changes during the budget period.

The goal-threshold range thus established becomes the proximate yardstick for evaluation of opportunities.

The approach to the partial-ignorance problem described above can thus be seen to take advantage of usually available knowledge of industry characteristics, even when individual opportunities in the industry cannot be anticipated.

the circular dependence of the goals on the environment and of the choice of environment on the goals.

- LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES
Exclusive concern with proximate profitability would be almost certain to leave the firm run down at the end of the period. Total emphasis would be on current products and markets: on advertising, promotion, sales force, productivity of the manufacturing organization.

to remain profitable into the long term, the firm must continue to renew itself; new resources must be brought in and new products and markets must be developed.

Many key phases of this self-renewal activity have long lead times.

during the proximate period resource commitments must be made to such long-term needs as research and development, management training, and new plant and equipment.

If the behavior of the firm were guided solely by the proximate objective, expenditures for such purposes could not be justified and would be given very low priorities.

It is essential, therefore, to establish long-term objectives aimed at maintaining and increasing profitability after the proximate period.

The obstacle to setting these is that accurate ROI forecasts and measurements cannot be made for the long-term period.

A way around this obstacle is to abandon efforts to measure long-term profitability directly and to measure, instead, characteristics of the firm which contribute to it.

- Note Loc. 713  | Added on Friday, January 23, 2015, 06:05 AM this is v relevant.
1. Continuing growth of sales at least at the pace of the industry to enable the firm to maintain its share of the market.

2. Increase in relative market share to increase relative efficiency of the firm.

3. Growth in earnings to provide resources for reinvestment:

4. Growth in earnings per share to attract new capital to the firm.

5. Continuing addition of new products and product lines.

6. Continuing expansion of the firm's customer population.

7. Absence of excessive seasonal or cyclical fluctuations in sales and earnings and of consequent loss of competitive position through externally forced inefficiency in the use of the firm's resources.

Each of these factors is a partial indicator of long-term profitability potential; taken together they assure that the firm will have a strong competitive position vis-a-vis the environment.

To make good on this position, internal efficiency must be maintained.

Therefore, more direct indicators of efficiency are needed.

1. If turnover ratios are comparable to or better than those of competition; indications are strong that the firm is making good use of its resources.

2. Depth of critical skills is a key indicator of future profitability.

3. Human and organizational assets must' be backed up by modern physical assets.

These proxy (lower-level) yardsticks form a hierarchy which relates to the overall long-term objective of the firm in the manner shown in Figure 4.1.

If ROI is the ultimate measure of the firm's performance, why should management be concerned with the variety of contributing proxy measurements?

The answer is that, theoretically long-term ROI does indeed subsume other variables,

Proxy measurements below the level of ROI are also essential for diagnostic analysis of the firm's performance:

The proxy measurements shown in Figure 4.1 have been selected to make use of data which are commonly generated for such diagnostic purposes.

We propose that the common yardsticks be put to further uses: setting objectives, evaluating the firm's position against these objectives, and evaluating prospective product-market entries.

Selection-reference values for this purpose is similar to setting proximate objectives.

For a majority of yardsticks shown in Figure 4.1 quantitative. goal-threshold values can be set.

These goals are then applied to respective opportunities as they occur.

Not all of the proxy yardsticks will be applicable to all opportunities.

- FLEXIBILITY OBJECTIVE - ANOTHER ASPECT OF PARTIAL IGNORANCE
Proximate and long-term objectives evaluate product-market opportunities in the light of the probable trends in the industry and the economy.

the probable trends can be upset by unforeseeable events which may have relatively low probability of occurrence, but whose impact on profitability of the opportunity and on the firm as a whole would be major.

Although some catastrophes can be anticipated, a firm which tries to predict revolutions and inventions is undertaking a highly unproductive job.'

On the other hand, a firm can effectively buy insurance against catastrophes and put· itself in the way of potential discoveries.

This can be done by adding another major objective to the firm's master list -a flexibility objective.

Flexibility can be measured by two. proxy objectives: external flexibility achieved through a diversified pattern of product-market investments, and internal flexibility through liquidity of resources.

External flexibility is best described by the maxim of not putting all of one's eggs in a single basket.

This is achieved through a product-market posture which is sufficiently diversified to minimize the effect of a catastrophe and/or to put the firm into areas in which it can benefit from likely breakthroughs.

external flexibility can be either defensive, aggressive, or both.

Defensive flexibility can be measured in several ways:

1. By the number of independent [r] customers which take a substantial portion of the firm's sales.

2. By the number of market segments in the firm's posture which belong to different economies.

3. By the number of independent technologies underlying the firm's product-market posture.

Aggressive flexibility is more elusive and harder to implement and measure.

it maximizes the chance of participating in breakthroughs.

1. One measure is the firm's participation in areas of technology which are in ferment.

2. Another essential measure is the relative strength of the firm's research and development in these areas.

Defensive external flexibility is easier to achieve and easier to measure, whereas aggressive external flexibility offers the real rewards-.

By contrast, concern with internal flexibility is as old as business itself.

The traditional yardstick of internal flexibility is liquidity of the, firm's resources, and among the measures are the current ratio, the acid test (an extreme measure of flexibility which measures 'instant response'), the debt to equity ratio, and the fixed to current asset ratio.

The hierarchy of the flexibility objective is shown on Figure 4.2.

sound qualitative assessment of external flexibility is probably. more important and reliable than efforts to assign numbers.

- NON-ECONOMIC OBJECTIVES, RESPONSIBILITIES, AND CONSTRAINTS
The flexibility objective completes the hierarchy needed for practical elaboration of the central economic objective.

other influences are present in many firms, which modify the economic objective and sometimes even replace it as the focus.

these' will be called non-economic influences, even though some of them directly influence the firm's search of profit.

It is convenient to separate these into those generated by factors internal to the firm and those due· to the ·external environment.

We shall further classify (as defined in Chapter 3) these influences into operating objectives, responsibilities, and constraints.

Since the responsibilities do not interact with the firm's choice of products and markets in the strategy formulation process, they can be treated as constraints.

The distinction between constraints and objectives resides in the fact that the former represent the limits within which the firm must operate, whereas the latter are the goals which the firm strives to attain. [58]

defns
Constraints and responsibilities severely limit the freedom of strategic action.

One of the major sources of internal influence on the firm is the objectives and ambitions of its diverse participants.

Another source may be certain institutional characteristics which have developed historically within the firm.

Cyert and March argue that 'organizations do not have objectives, only people have objectives'.64

we shall recognize both institutional influences and personal objectives as affecting strategic decisions in the firm.

Institutional influences act largely as constraints on both objectives and strategy.

- OBJECTIVES OF INDIVIDUALS
Objectives of individuals stem from many diverse origins and are difficult to organize into a hierarchical relationship, such as was presented for the economic objectives.

some of the most important personal influences on the firm.

1. Maximum Current Earnings.

2. Capital Gains.

strategic decision process was focused on short-term profitability to the exclusion of both the long-range and the flexibility objectives.

Among the competing philosophies of .objectives, some economists [67] argue that maximization of the market value of equity is the appropriate central objective for the firm.

3. Liquidity of Estate.

Two major alternatives to this end are to 'go public', or to merge the firm with another large one which is publicly held and widely traded.

If public issue is the object, emphasis will be placed on current profitability and on a 'growth image' created through the medium of public statements and reports.

If a merger is being sought, more than just an 'image' is needed, because, before acquisition, the firm's operations will be subjected to a careful scrutiny of another management.

4. Social Responsibility ...  = Equals Enlightened Self-interest.

The consequences are not only improvements in social welfare, but also economic benefit for the firm.

5. Social Responsibility - Philanthropy.

Philanthropic objectives of influential participants lead to support of non-profit institutions, such as educational, medical, scientific foundations; public charities; and religious institutions.

certain philanthropic obligations tend to become institutionalized.

6. Attitude toward Risk.

Attitude toward risk is a major constraint which must be taken into account in formulating objectives and particularly in establishing their priorities:

The rather complex preceding discussion of non-economic influences has been summarized for quick reference in Figure 4.3.

The listings are intended to be suggestive rather than exhaustive,

The procedure is to single. out non-economic influences within the firm which have a strong bearing on the economic objective, and then to assess the extent to which these affect the attributes and the priorities on the firm's master list of objectives.

- THE PROCESS OF SETTING OBJECTIVES
An effort to establish realistic objectives for a business firm has led' us to a complex structure of proxy objectives and sub-objectives.

This complexity results from the practical limitations on evaluating long-term profitability of the firm and from the presence of non-economic objectives.

An overall hierarchy of the diverse objectives discussed in the preceding sections is summarized in Figure 4.4.

We have tried to identify the principal yardsticks by which the objectives can be measured and also the mechanism by which non-economic objectives and constraints generated within the firm affect the economic objective.

In a more normal case, the non-economic influences serve to enlarge the master list. As a minimum, they may have some effect on priorities and goal values.

The preceding discussion outlined the steps in constructing a master list of constraints and objectives. The next steps are the assigning of relative priorities and goals values to each.

Three major economic variables affect priorities:

1. the firm's current and past performance,

2. the total resources available to the firm,

3. the characteristics and, opportunities in the 'external' competitive environment.

If the firm happens to have pursued one of the objectives to the detriment of others, then there is presumptive evidence that reallocation of priorities is in order.

availability, of resources also affects priorities.

Finally, and very importantly, the characteristics of the product-market environment have a major effect on priorities.

The concept of the industry life-cycle offers a convenient vehicle for discussion.

In the early exploratory stages of an industry, the prevalent concern of the participants is external competitive strength and the use of newly available technology to establish new product lines and markets.

As the industry becomes structured, internal efficiency becomes the guiding objective, and the emphasis is on developing an effective and efficient business organization.

Later, strongly competitive interactions may develop -particularly if the industry is taken over by a small number of competent firms. At this point objectives are again focused on maintenance and enhancement of a strong position vis-a-vis competitors.

As the industry approaches maturity, near-term potential becomes dimmed partly through saturation of demand and partly because of the very high costs of further market penetration at the expense of competitors. At this point major emphasis is placed on long-term growth and flexibility.

The preceding remarks clearly show that the choice of objectives is not free.

The firm is free to select the basic philosophy, and it has freedom in assigning priorities to non-economic objectives. But when it comes to the economic priorities, the choice is dictated by a number of factors which are all beyond management control.

- Note Loc. 948  | Added on Saturday, January 24, 2015, 10:38 AM important
The same is true of the selection of goals, as was already demonstrated in earlier sections,

Thus realistic objectives cannot be arbitrarily decreed in a smoke-filled boardroom. They must be developed through a continuing interaction of objectives and other elements of the strategic problem.

a partial schematic is shown in Figure 45.

It starts with a choice of the basic philosophy.

Next, the firm's current objectives are summarized.

If these do not exist in explicit form, they should be inferred to the extent possible from the firm's past behavior and supplemented with 'smoke-filled room' tentative decisions.

In parallel with this effort an appraisal of the firm's position is instituted in a manner to be discussed later.

Next, the current objectives are evaluated in the light of the appraisal and adjusted accordingly.

Figure 4.5. Process of objectives formulation. (Dotted lines denote part of process which has been oversimplified for this schematic.)

Objectives are a management tool with many potential uses.

In the operating problem they can be used for establishing performance standards and objectives for all organizational levels, for appraisal of performance, and for control decisions.

In the administrative problem they can be used to diagnose deficiencies in the organizational structure.

In our main area of interest, the strategic problem, objectives are used as yardsticks for decisions on changes, deletions, and additions to the firm's product-market posture.

In this role the mere evaluation of an opportunity on several dimensions of the objectives vector is not sufficient. The final acceptance or rejection requires an overall relative figure of merit to be assigned to each opportunity.

This problem of selecting opportunities which are measured by a number of incommensurate components, of an objectives vector does not have a satisfactory solution at present.

we decided to face the real-world fact that data are not available to produce a single index number to represent the firm's objective.

A specific method for evaluating incommensurate components of objectives will be developed in Chapter 9.

## CHAPTER 5. Synergy and Capability Profiles
- THE PROBLEM
IN this chapter we begin to explore synergy, 'which is one of the major components of the firm's product-market strategy.

a product-market posture with a combined performance that is greater than the sum of its parts.

- in Chapter 2 for a strategic decision method, we described synergy as a measure of joint effects.

defn
If it were practically possible in each instant to compute the marginal cash flows into and out of the firm for each new project, the requirement would not exist, since this aspect of project evaluation would be adequately covered by capital investment theory. Nor would it exist if it were possible to compute quickly and efficiently the new flows for the entire firm each time a new project came along.

As a substitute for these infeasible approaches; we shall derive' a method for qualitative estimation of joint effects.

- Note Loc. 991  | Added on Saturday, January 24, 2015, 10:53 AM imt
measurement of synergy is similar in many ways to what is frequently called 'evaluation of strengths and weaknesses'. In synergy, joint effects are measured between two product-markets; in strength and weakness evaluation, the firm's competences are rated relative to some desired performance level.

the difference is largely one of viewpoint.

At the end of the chapter we shall have a multipurpose technique which can be used to 1. evaluate any internal strengths and weaknesses within the firm, 2. derive synergy characteristics which the firm can use in its search for opportunities, and 3. measure the synergy potential between the firm and a possible acquisition.

- CONCEPT OF SYNERGY
Each product brings in annual sales of S dollars. Operating costs of O dollars are incurred for labor, materials, overhead, administration, and depreciation.

To develop the product, to provide facilities and equipment, and to set up a distribution network, an investment of I dollars must be made in product development, tooling, buildings, machinery, inventories, etc.

The annual rate of return, ROI, on product P1 can be written in the form ROI = (S1-O1)/I1

A similar expression can be written for all products in the product line: Pl, P2, ... , Pn.

the total sales of the firm will be ST = S1 + S2 + ... + Sn

The return on the investment for the firm as a whole will be (ROI)T = (ST-OT)/IT

This condition obtains whenever the revenues, the operating costs, and the investments are unrelated. Therefore, their totals can be obtained through simple additions.

In a majority of firms, advantages of scale exist under which a large firm with the same total sales as a number of small firms can operate at a cost which is lower than the sum of the operating costs for the separate enterprises.

the potential return on investment for an integrated firm is higher than the composite return which would. be obtained if the same dollar volumes for its respective products were produced by a number of independent firms:

A similar argument can, of course, be made by keeping the total investment fixed.

A firm which takes care to select its products and markets so as to optimize the effect has great flexibility in choosing its competitive stance.

- TYPES OF SYNERGY
One way to classify the several types of synergy is in terms of the components of the ROI formula:

1. Sales Synergy.

This can occur when products use common distribution channels, common sales administration, or common warehousing.

2. Operating Synergy. This is the result of higher utilization of facilities and personnel, spreading of overhead, advantages of common learning curves, and large-lot purchasing.

3. Investment Synergy. This can result from joint use of plant, common raw materials inventories, transfer of research and development from-one product to another, common tooling, common machinery.

4. Management Synergy. Although not immediately apparent from the formula, this type is an important contributor to the total effect.

If upon entering a new industry management finds the new problems to be similar to the ones it has encountered in the past, it is in a position to provide forceful and effective guidance to the newly acquired venture. Since competent top level management is a scarce commodity, very positive enhancement of performance can result in the combined enterprise.

This example points to the fact that management synergy, as well as the other types, can be negative as well as positive.

TABLE 5.1 [z] Functional Synergy between Industry Groups

It is seen that the best transfer of functional competence will occur in general management, where many practices and skills in accounting, finance, industrial relations, and public relations are common among industries.

However, even here the differences in the competitive environment and in basic resource allocation problems have led us to give unequal ratings to different pairs of industrial areas.

- START-UP SYNERGY AND OPERATING SYNERGY
the synergistic effect can be measured in either of two ways: by estimating the cost economics to the firm from a joint operation for a given level or revenue, or by estimating the increase in net revenue for a given level of investment.

In this section we shall take the first approach and discuss the nature of synergy through analysis of cost economies and diseconomies.

Acquisition of a new product–market area goes through two successive phases, start-up and operating.

the costs associated with start-up include the highly intangible costs of learning a new kind of business: setting up a new organization, establishing new rules and procedures, hiring new skills and competences, paying for mistakes in developing organizational relationships and for early bad decisions made in unfamiliar business, environment, and costs of gaining customer acceptance.

Although these are one-time costs, most of them are not capitalized, but charged to operating expense during the start-up period.

They are difficult to pinpoint, since many of them are not identified -(no ... but are evident only indirectly through substandard operating efficiencies.

start-up in new business can have potentially negative as well as positive synergy; a firm with positive synergy will have a competitive advantage over a firm which lacks it.

In addition to the direct and hidden dollar costs, start-up in a new product-market often carries a penalty for time delay.

The timing advantage in synergy becomes particularly desirable when the new entry is in a dynamic fast-growth stage.

- Note Loc. 1107  | Added on Saturday, January 24, 2015, 11:29 AM this may become relevant in CSTI in the future.

Thus, during the start-up phase, synergy can, occur in two forms: in the form of dollar savings to the firm thanks to the existence of competences, appropriate to the new line of business, and in the form of time savings in becoming fully competitive.

The second category of costs incurred in a new entry is the costs of a going concern, the operating costs and the investment required to support the operation.

Here two basic effects operate to produce synergy. One is the advantage of scale - many operations will produce at a lower unit cost when the total volume is increased.

A more subtle effect in synergy is a distribution of the burden of overhead expenses over a number of products. This arises from the fact that most overhead functions require a certain minimum level of effort for a wide range of business volume.

For example, a sales management and administration function must be staffed regardless of whether the firm has one product or a full line; the same research must be conducted regardless of whether it supports one or many products (so long as the products are all based on the same technology).

- Note Loc. 1121  | Added on Saturday, January 24, 2015, 11:32 AM ex of fixed admin overhead
In general, synergy effects during start-up will go hand in hand with operating synergy. However, the strength of the respective effects will differ.

- SYMMETRY AND JOINT EFFECTS
the effects of synergy are symmetric. While the diversifying firm offers benefits to the new product line, it may receive substantial benefits in return.

Further, while the viewpoint of cost and investment economics used above is convenient, it fails to account for a full range of potential synergistic benefits.

synergy is most frequently sought as a quick way to accelerate growth without additional major investments.

A less frequent, but much sought after, effect occurs when by combining resources the joint firm gains access to product-markets to which neither could previously gain access without a major investment.

- A FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATION OF SYNERGY
In principle, all synergistic effects can be mapped on one of three variables.

Increased volume of dollar revenue to the firm from sales, decreased operating costs, and decreased investment requirements. All three are viewed in the perspective of time; therefore, a fourth synergistic effect is the acceleration of the respective changes in the three variables.

the mapping is frequently not possible, particularly when strategic moves contemplate product-markets in which the firm has little previous experience.

Our general approach to it in this book is to construct a separate measurement of each important effect and, in a later chapter, to construct a method for applying these measures jointly to overall evaluation of a project.

A framework for assessing synergy is shown in Table 5.2, which in effect summarizes the developments of this chapter.

- Note Loc. 1158  | Added on Saturday, January 24, 2015, 11:36 AM see table
Synergy ·effects are first grouped by the primary functional areas of the firm: general management, research and development, marketing,· and operations (which includes manufacturing, purchasing, inventory control, distribution, and warehousing).

Within each functional area three possible symmetric effects are considered:

1. The contribution which the new product-market entry can make to the 'firm.

2. The contribution from the parent to the entry.

3. Further product-market moves which the two 'will be able to undertake as a result of the consolidation.

The columns in the table list the variables to be considered in connection with each of the categories. The headings of the columns list the various ways in which synergistic effects may manifest themselves

The entries in Table 5.2 should be measurements of the strength of a particular effect. Wherever possible, they should be assigned a numerical value, such as 'reduction of 40,000 square feet in plant requirements' or '20 per cent increase of sales on same investment base'.

Failing this, the entries will be relative qualitative ratings.

A column is provided for the overall synergy rating, most likely a qualitative one, for each functional area.

These in tum can be combined into one overall rating for the prospective entry.

- STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESS
Management literature dealing with problems of product-market change suggests that one of the early steps following the formulation of objectives should be an analysis of ‘strengths and weaknesses’ or, as more appropriately described by Staudt, ‘an audit of tangible and intangible resources for diversification’.

- Note Loc. 1194  | Added on Monday, January 26, 2015, 05:56 AM good cite
The audit has two purposes. First, it can identify deficiencies in the firm's present skills and resources which can be corrected short of diversification.

Second, it can identify strengths from which the firm can lead in pursuing diversification and/or deficiencies which it may wish to correct through diversification.

The strengths from which the firm wishes to lead are readily identified from the preceding discussion as the synergy component of the firm's strategy.

Thus the problem of strengths and weaknesses and the problem of synergy are seen to be related.

the estimates made in both problems are relative.

In the first part of the audit the firm's deficiencies are compared with those of its successful competitors. In the second part the strengths can only be identified relative to the industries into which the firm seeks to diversify.

In order to accommodate synergy and strengths and weaknesses within the same analytic framework, we shall use the method of profile comparison.

we shall develop the framework for a capability profile which rates a particular pattern of skills and facilities relative to some reference level.

first constructing a grid which matches functional areas in the firm against its skills and competences, and then by providing a checklist for entries into the grid.

- GRID OF COMPETENCES
The framework we seek must possess two key features.

To be widely applicable, it must be constructed in terms of competence areas which are common to most industries; to be applicable to a single firm, these areas must list specific skills and resources which differentiate between success and failure in different types of business.

we are seeking a common framework with differentiated contents within it.

a fully integrated manufacturing firm has the most comprehensive framework of capabilities, we shall use it as a point of reference.

The individual skills and resources can be organized along the same major functional areas as in the preceding table:

1. Research and development -which we define to encompass the entire process of creating a marketable product.

defn
Included are pure arid applied research, construction of breadboards and prototypes, industrial design, and preparation of manufacturing drawings.

Also included is development of manufacturing processes and techniques.

Market research is included insofar as it is concerned with determining the price-performance characteristics of the product and the size and structure of the market.

defns cont
2. Operations is concerned with procurement of raw materials, scheduling and controlling production, tooling, manufacturing engineering, quality control, inventory. and manufacturing the product.

defn
3. Marketing is taken as a broad activity concerned with creating product acceptance, advertising, sales promotion, selling, distributing the product (including transportation and warehousing), contract administration, sales analysis and, very importantly, servicing the product.

defn
4. General management and finance is taken to include three areas of activity:

a. Determining the overall pattern of relationships between the firm and its environment.

This includes determination of strategy and the total resource allocation, acquisition of new product-market positions for the firm, obtaining necessary financing, and maintaining public, relations.

b. Providing integrated decision making, guidance, and control to the functional areas -particularly in areas of pricing, inventory levels, production levels, capital expenditures, and individual functional goals.

c. Providing various staff services to the functional areas, such as accounting, industrial relations, personnel training, and, performing functions which are most efficiently carried out at centralized levels, such as purchasing.

Within each of these functional areas we recognize four categories of skills and resources:

1. Facilities and equipment.

2. Personnel skills.

3. Organizational capabilities

4. Management capabilities

- CONTENTS OF THE GRID
The dual classification presented above offers a refined grid for assessing a firm's competences. We must next concern ourselves with the contents.

The purpose is to develop a master list of entries which will contain the different kinds of capabilities encountered in American industry.

The purpose is, rather, to provide a master checklist which can be refined by each firm.

A major difficulty in determining the success function of consumer products is that customer acceptance is seldom based on measurable performance characteristics of the product. More frequently it is determined by a complex of factors (the interaction of which is imperfectly understood):

apparent performance advantage conveyed to the customer through advertising and, sales promotion, price advantage, ready availability of product, fashion, social pressure, artificial obsolescence of preceding products.

capabilities which are of greatest importance in consumer business lie in the area of merchandising skills -in advertising, product styling, promotion, distribution, and selling.

In industrial products the' interaction tends to be somewhat less complex. The critical factor in product acceptance is its economic justification: demonstrable ability of the product to make money for the buyer (in the form of savings or increased income).

Price differential is important, but is related to quality.

Of great importance is a demonstrated ability of the product to perform reliably.

Among key competitive skills in industry are knowledge of customer's economic justification levels and an ability to design to them, ability to translate new technology into reliable products, special process and manufacturing competences, patent protection, sensitivity to customer needs and requirements, and an ability to provide quick and efficient product service.

End products sold to military and space missions succeed, primarily if their performance capabilities are in excess of anything which had been previously available. In addition, they must be virtually failure-free during intermittent periods of all-out performance under extreme environmental conditions.

A major competitive skill is an ability to apply the most advanced state of the art to products and systems. Organizational competence to manage development and manufacturing of technologically advanced, highly complex systems is another central skill.

A very substantial share of military and space business differs from the industrial in that the customer usually buys a design (and a very preliminary one at that) instead of an existing product.

This puts emphasis on a very special kind of marketing competence

Technical quality of the design, past performance on similar contracts, technical and scientific reputation, and geopolitical advantages enjoyed by the firm all play an important role in marketing. The salesman is frequently a middleman between engineering and the customer, rather than an active merchandiser.

Many industrial products (components, for example) have competitive characteristics closely resembling those in the consumer business.

The large arid growing non-military government market (Federal, state, municipal) has features in common with both military and industrial markets.

- COMPETENCE AND COMPETITIVE PROFILES
The example describes a part of what we shall· call the firm's competence profile. It is a list of the major skills and competences in the firm (identified with the aid of Table 5.3) rated with respect to other firms which have the same capabilities.

The competence profile is the basic reference profile for the firm. It is relatively permanent and will need updating only when major changes occur in the capabilities.

The competence profile is a strength and weakness profile only relative to specific areas of competences and skills. It does not necessarily denote strengths and weaknesses with respect to a particular product-market position,

The major use of the competence profile is in assessment of this balance in four different parts of the strategic problem.

1. Internal Appraisal.

a competitive profile is conducted which presents the capability pattern of the most successful competitors" in the industry.

competence and the competitive profiles are now superimposed to determine the areas in which the firm is either outstanding or deficient. These are the strengths and weak-, nesses relative to the present product-market posture.

2. External Appraisal.

A part of the evaluation will measure the growth and profitability characteristics of the various industries; another part measures the synergy potential between the firm and each new industry, since synergy determines the firm's ability to make a successful and profitable entry.

This requires a competitive profile for each industry,

Superposition of our firm's competence profile with the respective competitive profiles measures the' fit' with each new industry and hence the chances of a successful entry.

3. Synergy Component of Strategy.

a procedure like the above is used, but the competence profile is now compared with competitive profiles for a few selected industries.

The management has a choice of an aggressive strategy, in which the strengths are used as search criteria, or a defensive strategy, in which the search is directed toward remedying the weaknesses, or both.

4. Evaluation of Individual Opportunities.

Once search has uncovered a promising acquisition or a new product, a final evaluation must be made.

Profiles of the firm and of the acquisition are constructed and superimposed. Then:

a. The resulting pattern is compared with the competitive profile of a successful competitor in the firm's own business developed in item 1. above

b. The superimposed profiles are similarly compared with a profile of a successful firm in the new entry's industry,

c. Finally superimposed profiles are compared with typical profiles developed under 2. above to see whether the combination of the two firms' skills will provide an entry into an industry Which neither could enter above.

This procedure of using paired profiles to fill in Table 5.2 is laborious and should be used primarily at the 'short strokes' of an acquisition.

## CHAPTER 6. Concept of Strategy
- THE PROBLEM
a firm needs a well-defined scope and growth direction, that objectives alone do not meet this need, and that additional decision rules are required if the firm is to have orderly and profitable growth.

Such decision rules and guidelines have been broadly defined as strategy or, sometimes, as the concept of the firm's business.

defn
capital investment theory makes no use of the concept of strategy.

a firm needs direction and focus in its search for and creation of new opportunities and the fact that it is to the firm's advantage to seek entries with strong synergistic potential.

The first two sections of this chapter are devoted to developing a concept of strategy

Next, the question is raised whether, and under what conditions; a firm needs to have a strategy.

In the third section an answer is provided which relates the type of preferred strategy to the type of firm.

Definitions of strategy found in business literature are different from ours and are sometimes used interchangeably with the term 'policy'.

The last section compares these definitions and relates' them to different degrees of. uncertainty under which business decisions are made.

- CONCEPT OF THE FIRM'S BUSINESS AND THE COMMON THREAD
Objectives set the performance levels which a firm seeks to achieve, but they do not describe the business, of the firm, unless statements such as 'the firm is in 20 per cent ROI business' or in 'flexible position business' are constructed to provide the description.

defn
Levitt [76] has suggested that a more definitive description of the firm's role in the environment is requisite for growth and success.

The weakness with concepts such as 'transportation business' or 'energy business' is that they are too broad and do not provide what the investment community calls a 'common thread' -a relationship between present and future product-markets

A separate question is how strong the common thread must be.

In seeking to answer these questions it is useful to review how firms usually identify the nature of their business.

Some firms are identified by the characteristics of their product line.

Others are described by the technology which underlies the product line,

Firms are also described in terms of their markets. Here it is useful to make a distinction between customers and missions.

A mission is an existing product need; a customer is the actual buyer of the product: the economic unit (such as an individual, a family, a business firm) which possesses both the need and the money with which to satisfy it.

defns
sometimes the customer is erroneously identified as the common thread of a firm's business.

a given type of customer will frequently have a range of unrelated product missions or needs.

In selecting a useful range of missions of a particular customer, a firm needs to find a common thread either in product characteristics, technology, or similarity of needs.

In this perspective it is easy to see why the term' transportation business' fails to supply the common thread.

First, the range of possible missions is very broad:

Second, the range of customers is wide:

Third, the ‘product’ varies:

The number of practical combinations of the variables is large, and so is the number of common threads.

- Note Loc. 1386  | Added on Monday, January 26, 2015, 06:24 AM combinations of mission... customer... product.

Today a great many firms find themselves in a number of different industries.

the boundaries of industries are continually changing, and new ones are being born.

The need is for a concept of business which on the one hand will give specific guidance for the firm and on the other hand will provide room for growth.

- COMPONENTS OF STRATEGY
To the extent the respective objectives and goals are consonant with actual performance; they do provide an indirect description of a common thread.

A somewhat more positive specification of the common thread is arrived at through the use of the product-market scope.

This specifies the particular industries to which the firm confines its product-market position and it has the advantage of focusing,

To convey a common thread, description of the product-market scope frequently needs to, be made in terms of sub-industries which contain product-markets and technologies with similar characteristics.

Another useful specification of common thread is through the ' means of the growth vector, which indicates the direction in which the firm is moving with respect to its current product-market posture.

In ‘market development’ new missions are sought for the firm's products. ‘Product development’ creates new products to replace current ones.

‘diversification’ is distinctive in the fact that both products and missions are new to the firm.

Specification of the common thread through the growth vector is complementary to the product-market scope, since it gives the directions within an industry as well as across industry boundaries which the firm proposes to pursue.

A third way to see a common thread is to isolate characteristics of unique opportunities within the field defined by the product-market scope, and the growth vector. This is the competitive advantage.

The triplet of specifications -the product-market scope, the growth vector, and the competitive advantage - describes the firm's product-market path in the external environment.

The first describes the scope of search, the second the directions within the scope, and the third the characteristics of individual entries.

There remains one other alternative for describing the common thread, and that is synergy.

The common thread may be aggressive, requiring that new entries make use of an outstanding competence possessed by the firm (say, a nationwide chain of retail outlets or leadership in computer technology), or it may be defensive, requiring that new entries supply some key competence which the firm lacks.

It may, of course, be both aggressive and defensive.

Synergy is especially useful as the common thread in new growth areas where industry boundaries are ill-defined and changing. It is also a key variable in the choice of a diversification strategy.

The classification of common thread into product-market scope, growth vector, competitive advantage, and synergy is given added meaning when viewed in the light of the firm's search for profitability.

The first triplet of specifications describes the firm's search for inherently profitable opportunities in the external environment.

The four characteristics are thus complementary, rather than mutually exclusive. We will call them, therefore, the components of strategy.

defn
strategy and objectives together describe the concept of the firm's business.

A different and interesting classification of business strategies has been devised _by L. C. Sorrell. 77 Among his strategies are the following: 'strike while the -iron is hot', 'time is a great healer', 'bore from within', 'in union there is strength', 'draw a red herring across the trail', 'pass the buck', and 'conserve your gunpowder'.

- IS STRATEGY NECESSARY?
The question of the usefulness of strategy as a management tool must, therefore, be examined.

the alternative to strategy. This alternative is to have no rules beyond the simple decision to look for profitable prospects.

Several reasons can be given in favor of this approach.

1. The firm would save the time, money, and executive talent which are required for a thorough strategic analysis.

2. The field of potential opportunities will be in no way restricted. Objectives and strategy limit the field of its search.

3. The firm reaps the full advantage of the' delay principle '. By delaying commitment until an opportunity is in hand, it is able to act on the basis of the best possible information.

defn
Counterposed to these are some weighty disadvantages.

1. In the absence of strategy, there are no rules to guide the search for new opportunities, both inside and outside the firm.

2. Project decisions will be of poorer quality than in firms with strategy.

3. The firm will have no formal provision for partial ignorance.

4. Without the benefit of a periodic appraisal, the firm would have no assurance that its overall resource allocation pattern is efficient and that some product lines are not obsolete.

5. The firm will lack an internal ability to anticipate change.

To summarize, the advantages of not missing any bets and of not committing the firm's resources until the last moment are pitted against the disadvantages of inefficient search, enhanced risk of making bad decisions, and lack of control over the overall resource-allocation pattern.

strategy requirements will differ from one type of firm to another.

1. A type of firm which needs the most comprehensive strategy is a fully integrated operating firm.

2. A holding company has less -stringent strategy requirements.

3. At the other extreme from a fully integrated firm is a company which primarily buys and sells.

The three types of company above were described in what might be called 'pure form '. In actuality there are various shadings of characteristics which make it difficult to place firms into one of the slots.

the operating firm requires the most complex strategy.

- STRATEGY, POLICY, PROGRAMMES, AND OPERATING PROCEDURES
The concept of strategy is relatively new to management literature. Its historical origin lies in the military art, where it is a broad, rather vaguely defined, 'grand' concept of a military campaign for application of large-scale forces against an enemy.

Strategy is contrasted to tactics, which is a specific scheme for employment of allocated resources.

defn
The bridge to business usage was provided in 1948 by Von Neumann and Morgenstern [80] in their now-famous theory of games.

The theory provides a unifying viewpoint for all types· of conflict situations, regardless of whether their origin is in war, politics, or business.

The concept of strategy is given two meanings.

A pure strategy is a move or a specific series of moves by a firm, such as a product development program in which successive products and markets are clearly delineated.

defn
A grand or mixed strategy is a statistical decision rule for deciding which particular pure strategy the firm should select in a particular situation.

defn
Although game theory has not resulted in many practical applications, it has revolutionized ways of thinking about ·social problems in general and business in particular.

TABLE 6.2 Strategy Requirements/or Different Firms

In the business vocabulary, policy is also widely used in a very different sense in manuals of organization and procedures to denote a specific response to specific repetitive situations,

defn
while implementation of policy can be delegated downward, implementation of strategy cannot, since last-minute executive judgment will be required.

conditions of risk (alternatives are all known and so are their probabilities) or uncertainty (alternatives are known but not the probabilities),

defns
When the occurrence' is certain, but the outcome is either certain or uncertain, a different kind of decision, called a program, is possible; this is a time-phased action sequence used to guide and coordinate operations.

defn
Thus, the several types of decisions commonly made within a firm can be ranked in the order of increasing level of ignorance: standing operating procedures and programmes under conditions of certainty or partial risk, policies under conditions of risk and uncertainty, and strategies under conditions of partial ignorance.

There is an unfortunate coincidence in our definitions. We , speak of 'strategic' decisions [kk] , where 'strategic' means 'relating to firm's match to its environment', and of 'strategy’, where the word means 'rules for decision under partial ignorance'.

all four basic types of decision described above -'strategy, policy, program, arid standing operating procedure - occur in all three classes of problems: strategic, administrative; and operating.

all of the basic types of decisions may apply on organizational levels below the firm as a whole.

## CHAPTER 7. Why Firms Diversify
- THE PROBLEM
It was pointed out in Chapter 1 that a firm's concern with the strategic problem is not automatic 'and that, in the absence of a trigger signal, most managements will focus their attention on administrative and operating decisions.

In the first section of this chapter we explore alternative conditions for the trigger signal and suggest an approach to initiating a strategic analysis.

The second' section explores conditions under which diversification is indicated and relates the decision to management attitudes toward risk.

The third section explores alternative directions for diversification and relates these to the objectives of the firm.

- THE TRIGGER SIGNAL
strategic decisions are not self-regenerative.

Until the early 1920s there appears to have been no understanding of organizational implications of strategy.

concern with strategy had followed an' on-off’ cycle attuned to the appearance of major strategic opportunities, which were called 'new business frontiers'.

Chandler [84] traces the history of several such cycles during which broadening of product-market horizons alternated with periods of preoccupation with operating and administrative problems created by strategic change.

the changeover points frequently coincided with changes from one generation of management to another; far-sighted outward oriented entrepreneurs of the expansion era gave way to methodical profit-minded efficiency experts.

In the early 1920s, for quite different reasons, Du Pont and General Motors pioneered in the introduction of a new organizational concept.

A layer of management was created in these firms divorced from operating responsibilities and charged with formu lation of policy and strategy, planning, and performance appraisal.

the new organizational concept encouraged, but did not guarantee, analysis of product-market strategy.

continual attention to strategy has remained dependent not only on organizational structure but also on the orientation of the management.

For firms which have no provisions for response to strategic challenges and which refuse to anticipate it, the awareness of the problem usually comes through a traumatic experience,

the challenge often comes at a time when the firm is ill-prepared to cope with it.

the tendency is to seek solutions in operating (cost reduction!) and administrative (reorganization!) changes.

- Note Loc. 1590  | Added on Tuesday, January 27, 2015, 06:23 AM important
There is considerable evidence to suggest that many firms can no longer treat strategic change as a one-time response,

Strategic change is so rapid that firms must continually survey the productmarket environment in search for diversification opportunities.

1. In the present business environment, no firm can consider itself immune to threats of product obsolescence and saturation of demand.

2. In some industries, surveillance of the environment for strategic threats and opportunities needs to be a continuous process.

3. As a minimum, firms in all industries need to make regular periodic reviews of product-market strategy.

The key question, therefore, is not whether to direct management attentions to strategy, but rather how and to what extent.

certain preliminary guidelines for decision can be set down.

1. Clearly, the intensiveness of the analysis will be limited by the resources of the firm.

A one-man top management will of necessity be forced into a highly condensed review of strategy; a large multi-divisional firm can afford a thorough study.

- Note Loc. 1607  | Added on Tuesday, January 27, 2015, 06:26 AM my status
2. The characteristics of the firm's product-market environments will have a dominant influence.

a. If the industry is highly dynamic, change in technology rapid, and/or market structure unstable, the firm will need to put strategic change on a permanent basis.

b. If on the other hand, the industry is one of the few remaining ones which have enjoyed relative' stability in the past, it is best to wait until the first results are in before deciding on administrative changes.

3. The magnitude of the needed 'product-market realignment will influence the decision.

Both Chandler's book and common experience show that in many firms newly created top-level policy makers continue to run rather than plan the company.

- Note Loc. 2214  | Added on Tuesday, January 27, 2015, 06:28 AM important
The costs and the risks attendant on strategic change require that top executive talent be given full-time responsibility for the effort and that it be supported with adequate staff resources and budgets.

This issue becomes particularly acute in a small firm where all kinds of' indirect' staff expense have traditionally been viewed as wasteful and to be avoided at all cost.

if the firm is in a highly dynamic environment, it will obtain better growth and profitability if part of the total budget is used to support a small staff created for the purpose of searching out new products and markets, performing exploratory market research, and evaluating opportunities.

- WHY FIRMS DIVERSIFY
Strategic change, as we have defined it, is a realignment of the firm's product-market environment.

defn
The growth is now in two parts, expansion and diversification.

the former consists of market penetration, market development, and product development.

- Note Loc. 1630  | Added on Tuesday, January 27, 2015, 06:31 AM defn of expansion
it is fair to say that in most firms strategy does not remain static but evolves, however slowly, in response to changes in environment. Until recently this process has remained largely unplanned.

- Note Loc. 1635  | Added on Tuesday, January 27, 2015, 06:31 AM gq
By its very definition diversification is the more drastic and risky of the two strategies, since it involves a simultaneous departure from familiar products and familiar markets.

A number of papers are available in management literature which list many different reasons for diversification. [89]

1. Firms diversify when their objectives can no longer be met within the product-market scope defined by expansion

2. Even if attractive expansion opportunities are still available and past objectives are being met, a firm may diversify, because the retained cash exceeds the total expansion needs.

3. Even if current objectives are being met, a firm may diversify when diversification opportunities promise greater profitability than expansion opportunities.

This may occur under several conditions.

a. When diversification opportunities are sufficiently attractive to offset their inherently lower synergy.

b. When the firm's research and development organization produces outstanding diversification by-products.

c. When synergy is not an important consideration and hence the synergy advantages of expansion over diversification are not important.

4. Firms may continue to explore diversification when the available information is not reliable enough to permit a conclusive comparison between expansion and diversification.

In such situations many firms have shown in the recent past an unfortunate tendency to plunge rather than probe.

A much less costly long-run approach is to buy reliable information before buying diversification.

As was suggested in Chapter 3, the goals of the firm are not absolute, but are closely related to opportunities. Under reasons 2 and 3 above, firms would pursue diversification when an opportunity to revise the goals upward presents itself. Under reason 1, if analysis of opportunities shows that diversification cannot improve the firm's position, the goals will have to be revised downward.

This absence of an absolute ‘proper’ set of goals for a firm gives the management great latitude in exercising its risk preferences.

differences of attitude will obviously have a major influence on the decision to diversify or not.

- DIVERSIFICATION ALTERNATIVES
In the preceding section we had divided the growth direction vector into an expansion and a diversification component.

- Note Loc. 1677  | Added on Wednesday, January 28, 2015, 05:49 AM industry growth is related to new entrants and extant firm growth. firm growth is accomplished by expansion or diversification.

Each can be further expanded in terms of characteristics of products and customers in relation to the present product-market position. Such expansion is shown in Figure 7.2

- Note Loc. 1678  | Added on Wednesday, January 28, 2015, 05:50 AM see fig 7.2
we have prepared a sample table of growth vector alternatives for an autoI1mobiIe manufacturer. This is shown in Figure 7.3.

- Note Loc. 1682  | Added on Wednesday, January 28, 2015, 05:51 AM see fig 7.3
An important characteristic of horizontal diversification is that it consists of moves within the economic environment of the diversifying firm. Therefore, those industries which happen to contribute horizontal opportunities will usually rank low on flexibility and will contribute little toward improvement of stability of the firm.

The strong common thread in this type of diversification is found in marketing synergy,

Vertical integration is even more sensitive-to instabilities and will offer less assurance of flexibility.

by putting more eggs into the same end-product basket, vertical integration increases the firm's dependence oil a particular segment of economic demand.

- Note Loc. 1689  | Added on Wednesday, January 28, 2015, 05:52 AM spacex is bettimg the farm on govt demand. so atr the chinese the french the russians...

Synergy will be strong if technology is related, but may actually be quite weak, and even negative, in the case of unrelated technology.

If the new operation is loosely controlled by the parent and integrated into the parent organization, diseconomies may occur, and inappropriate management decisions may be made.

This danger is aggravated if the parent cannot absorb all of the subsidiary's output and must learn new marketing techniques by selling to his own competitors!

Thus both vertical and horizontal diversification vectors offer only a limited potential for objectives.

They make a limited contribution to flexibility and stability and they will contribute to the other objectives only if the present economic environment of the firm is healthy and growing.

The remaining two directions -concentric and conglomerate diversification - differ in the degree of synergy with the firm's present position.

concentric diversification has a measure of common thread with the firm either through marketing or technology or both.

defn
Conglomerate diversification, by definition, has none.

defn
a concentric strategy which matches a conglomerate strategy on economic prospects and on flexibility will usually be more profitable and less risky, because of synergy.

- Note Loc. 1701  | Added on Wednesday, January 28, 2015, 05:56 AM diversification has four dimensions... horizontal... vertical... concemtric and conglomerate.

one would expect the concentric strategy to be preferred by an overwhelming majority of firms. In point of fact, however, the record shows the opposite; a great many appear to follow the conglomerate path. Several reasons can be offered for this.

1. There are many cases where firms have no strategy beyond a desire for profitable opportunities.

2. The capabilities of some firms are too highly specialized or too obsolete to have synergy with other kinds of business.

- The former appears to be the cause in the search by missile-space' companies for compatible diversification' opportunities outside the defense industry,

- Note Loc. 1709  | Added on Wednesday, January 28, 2015, 06:00 AM ansoff said this in the 1960s!
3. In some firms the depth of competence is too shallow to offer opportunities for synergy, so that all diversification moves are conglomerate in nature.

4. In some firms the management's preference and training· structure dispose it toward conglomerate growth.

it should be recognized that a well-formulated conglomerate strategy does have a sense of direction expressed through competitive advantage, product-market scope, and objectives, albeit less definite than in the concentric case,

it is useful to set forth the advantages and limitations of a purely conglomerate diversification strategy.

1. Conglomerate strategy can improve the overall profitability and flexibility of the firm through acquisition in industries which have better economic characteristics than those of the acquiring firm.

2. Although the consolidated performance may improve the firm's position, firms which pursue a conglomerate strategy into growth fields frequently dilute the earnings of their stockholders.

3. In the absence of synergy, the combined operating performance of a conglomerate firm will in general be no better than it would have been if the divisions operated as independent firms.

4. A conglomerate firm does have a potential advantage of better access to capital markets and better stability of earnings under normal conditions.

5. However, there is evidence [93] that under abnormal conditions, such as a recession, conglomerate firms have less staying power than concentric ones and hence suffer sharper reversals.

6. The inherent economic potential of a new industry must not be the sole criterion for conglomerate acquisitions.

the acquiring firm should insist on a record of successful operation and evidence of competent management.

7. Organizational strategy is of great importance in conglomerate acquisitions.

## CHAPTER 8. The Appraisal
- THE PROBLEM
THUS far we have been concerned with development of basic concepts and tools for strategic analysis. The remainder of the book 1s devoted to using these in constructing a step-by-step solution of the strategic problem.

the expansion component of strategy offers strong transfer of product technology, or marketing competence, or both.

In diversification, novel products are acquired and previously unexplored markets are entered. Therefore, given two otherwise equal opportunities, synergy will be higher in expansion than in diversification.

Put somewhat differently, this means that if a firm can meet all of its objectives by measures short of diversification, it should do so.

Since diversification is costly and risky, the first section of this chapter (internal appraisal) is concerned with whether the firm can solve its problems without' diversifying.

If the problem cannot be solved within the limit of the present product-market position, presumption is strong that the firm has to diversify;

In any case, a decision to continue analysis calls for a survey of opportunities outside the firm's present product-market scope (external appraisal).

A decision to diversify raises the question of whether the new acquisitions will be integrated into the firm's present organizational structure, or whether the structure will be varied so as to take advantage of the synergy potential.

the flow of decisions leading to strategy formulation is complex, involves many contributing studies, and that it can be very time consuming.

Many firms, particularly smaller ones, may not be in a position to make such commitments.

- INTERNAL APPRAISAL
The decision flow diagram for an internal appraisal is shown graphically in Figure 8.1.

strategic analysis may be typically triggered off by a signal of serious trouble or by a change in top management.

Forward-looking management may anticipate changes in the environment of the firm and act before difficulties arise.

Aggressive management will make strategic change a way of life and periodically review its strategy regardless of performance.

The first order of business will be preparation of tentative objectives

The procedure for setting these objectives was described in Chapters 3 and 4.

Concurrently, a current forecast (2) of future performance will be made.

Firms which have no experience with long-range planning will find that a useful procedure is to start with the past history of performance, extrapolate this into the future, and then adjust it for factors which are expected to produce deviations from trends.

If, after these adjustments, a significant gap remains, the analysis moves to the next phase. If there is no gap, conservatively' inclined management may choose to terminate analysis at this point until the next review date.

Entrepreneurial management will choose to proceed with the purpose of discovering whether the firm can do even better than indicated by the current forecast.

- Note Loc. 1798  | Added on Friday, January 30, 2015, 05:57 AM ansoff cateorizes mgt as either conservative or entrepreneurial.

It is necessary, therefore, to digress in order to make it clear that the term 'conservative' is in no sense meant to indicate a 'worse' choice, nor 'entrepreneurial' a 'better' one. We use these words to indicate different attitudes toward risk found among managers.

By choosing a 'conservative' path, in our sense of the word, "management chooses a combination of lower probable gain with a correspondingly lower risk than does an 'entrepreneur' who decides in favour of highergain-higher-risk course.

The first, strengths and weaknesses (5), has already been discussed in Chapter 5. It will be recalled that it involves constructing a competence profile for the firm and comparing it with profiles of successful competitors to develop a pattern of the firm's strengths and weaknesses relative to its present product-market strategy.

The other concurrent analysis is of the industry potential (6). Its purpose is to determine the growth potential available within the industry to a firm which is willing and able to make an all-out effort to capitalize on it.

industry potential explores the economic and competitive prospects for the industry as a whole. Trends in growth, profitability, and market shares are projected.

The technological trends and potential impact of new technologists are identified.

If the internal expansion measures promise to close the diversification gap, many firms will decide against diversification

a move from expansion to diversification entails, for some firms, not only greatly increased risks but also very high transfer costs.

Such firms are usually highly integrated, with large fixed investments in physical assets and specialized business and technological know-how.

They welcome an opportunity to redress imbalances in the present position without diversifying.

On the other hand, firms with highly fluid and, negotiable resources and without specialized know-how, such as an investment trust, would have no particular incentive to stop the analysis at this point. The incentive is rather to survey the broadest possible field of opportunities before selecting the product-market posture.

Resource analysis should single out the particular resources which may become limiting factors (8) in strategic activity.

It has to be recognized that diversification resources are self-regenerative, i.e. use of equity to acquire a fulfill may bring in a rich supply of ready cash for further expansion.

Although accurate measurements of feasibility will not be possible until after outside opportunities are explored, major infeasibilities will be apparent at this stage.

- EXTERNAL APPRAISAL
The purpose of external appraisal is to analyze the productmarket opportunities which are available to the firm outside its present scope and thus produce the final decision on whether the firm shall diversify.

All opportunities are arrayed, each is tested for its contribution to the firm, and a group of top-ranking ones is selected for the diversification portfolio.

in practice this is a difficult task. A recapitulation of the major problems will help establish the logic for the external appraisal.

A major problem is posed by the fact that, instead of a single -measurement, the purpose of the firm is described by a multidimensional vector of objectives.

These objectives are measured in different units (they are not commensurate), and they compete for the firm's resources (they are not colinear).

proximate objective competes with the long-range ones, and the flexibility objectives compete with both.

A second major problem is partial ignorance; at decision time we do not have the assurance that all of the forthcoming attractive opportunities have been identified and described.

A third problem arises from" the averaging characteristics of industry data. Stacked against objectives these disclose whether the desired economic and technological potential exists within the industry as a whole. It does not answer this question from the viewpoint of an individual participant in the industry.

This answer is often different for two reasons.

First, the prospects for an individual firm in an industry can differ significantly from those of the industry as a whole.

Second, a firm considering an entry into an industry must take account of the cost of both entry and exit.

The cost of entry and exit is also significant for a different reason.

If the market shares in the industry are widely distributed and the minimum investment required to enter is small, great mobility of firms in and out is to be expected.

To study these competitive considerations we shall first add several criteria which measure the competitive pressures and prospects in the industry to the list of economic criteria generated by objectives.

cost of entry criteria. These will assess individual industries for the relative cost of entry and for· availability of attractive entries.

- Note Loc. 1939  | Added on Friday, January 30, 2015, 06:17 AM exit
A fourth problem arises from the fact that a majority of diversifying firms expect to ·integrate the new activity into the parent operation. This adds synergy criteria to the economic and competitive criteria.

The analysis commences with preparation of the three lists of criteria described above: economic (1), cost of entry (2), and synergy (3)

The second step in the analysis is to develop lists of candidate industries.

Data are now collected for each industry along the dimensions indicated by the criteria. For convenience these are grouped into three categories: economic potential (7), competitive characteristics (8), and competitive profiles (9).

Internal constraints are policy limitations self-imposed by the firm.

An important external constraint in diversification is the possibility of violation of the provisions of the American Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts.

While this is usually not a problem for small firms, medium-sized and large firms which already have a substantial share of their markets are in danger that the very synergistic effects which the firm may seek will be interpreted 'by government agency to result in constraint of trade.

Although the antitrust legislation is the most widely recognized external constraint, the firm may be further limited by others.

Another example is a government policy requiring that prime contractors for weapons systems subcontract a certain minimum percentage of the sterling value to outside subcontractors. As a result major systems contractors may prefer to avoid potential conflict of interests and refrain from acquiring manufacturers of sub-systems and components.

Our suggestion is that rankings be constructed and consolidated in several steps.

First, the multitude of economic yardsticks should be reduced to a threefold rank according to economic criteria (13), with one column each for the proximate, long-term, and flexibility objectives.

The competitive pressures yardsticks are consolidated into the first two columns.

Second, a list is produced which ranks industries according to cost of entry (14).

cost of entry and availability of entry yardsticks (Table 8.3) are consolidated into a single figure of merit; thus; this list will contain only one column.

The following variants of the decision to diversify are possible.

1. In rare cases, when internal appraisal forecasts a decline in the firm's present business in spite of all possible measures taken to reverse it, the indicated decision is to liquidate the firm as it now exists and to reinvest the proceeds into diversification, thus creating a new type of firm.

2. When the expansion forecast shows level sales or slow growth, a somewhat less drastic decision is to keep the present business, but to devote most of available resources to diversifica tion.

3. When both expansion and diversification opportunities are only moderately promising, but, upon comparison, no diversification opportunity is sufficiently superior to justify the added risks and the loss in synergy, the previous commitment of resources to expansion would be maintained.

4. When diversification opportunities are attractive enough to sacrifice expansion moves· and even relinquish some parts of present business, the revised forecast (7), the expansion (11), and the expansion resources (12) on Figure 8.2 are adjusted downward and the diversification gap (10) and resources for diversification (13) are correspondingly increased.

5. When the information obtained through the external appraisal is judged to be inadequate to commit the firm either way, several courses may be pursued:

a. A decision to develop more information may be made.

b. Another, not infrequent, decision is that information about· diversification is inherently less reliable than information about expansion and that the advantages of diversification are not worth the risk. The firm will pursue the expansion strategy.

c. A third is a decision by default. An attempt to formulate strategy will lead nowhere, but the firm ought to 'look around' for individual attractive opportunities.

This case of companies in search for opportunities, without a clear idea of what they are looking for or a clear management commitment to act,· is descriptive of a number of so-called' diversification programs in American firms.

- SYNERGY AND STRUCTURE
The external appraisal produced two lists which rank industries on objectives and synergy.

The synergy rankings can be viewed as modifiers of the objectives ratings;

these are only potential advantages, estimated from a superposition of profiles and that they will not be realized unless the diversifying firm provides the appropriate organizational environment.

Thus synergy and structure of the firm's organization are seen to be dependent on each other. The relation can be resolved by making structure follow synergy.

adjusted so as to maximize synergy.

When strong synergy happens to exist at all levels of the firm, a tightly integrated organization would be used.

When synergy is strong only in general management, but not in functional areas, a decentralized organization is indicated.

Finally, when synergy potential is weak up and down the organization, a holding company structure is indicated.

To avoid negative synergy top management will delegate the strategic as well as operating decisions, reserving for itself only the area of corporate finance.

defn of a holding co?
Aside from management preferences, firms do not usually have the flexibility of structure to follow the vagaries of synergy. Nor would the synergistic advantages always offset the resulting costs and inefficiencies of structural change.

Rather than revise the overall organizational concept, the firm will usually force the acquisition to fit into the already existing structure and not worry about synergistic effects.

Whether synergy shall follow structure or vice versa is a major top management decision.

This decision needs to be made at this point, rather than delayed until an actual acquisition is in hand, because it affects strategy and hence the search and evaluation of opportunities.

## CHAPTER 9. Choice of Strategy
- THE PROBLEM
THE synergy-structure decision moves strategy formulation into its final stage.

The first step is to construct alternative portfolios' of product-market entries which are individually large enough to be competitive, which are related to each other, and which can be undertaken within the resources of the firm.

two problems, which have remained in the background until now, come into focus.

The first is how to trade off competing demands of proximate, long-term, and flexibility objectives.

The second problem, which so far has been only partially explored in this book, is how to allow for the risk associated with strategic decisions.

The remaining two components of strategy -competitive advantage and synergy - follow selection of scope and help sharpen the firm's search and evaluation of opportunities.

- PRODUCT-MARKET PORTFOLIOS
The synergy-structure decision results in a consolidated list of industries ranked on each of the major objectives.

usually, industries which are preferable for proximate profitability will be inferior to others on long-term objectives. Industries which would contribute most to flexibility will generally be deficient on near-term profitability because of lower synergy with the firm.

To provide the firm with an attractive overall product-market posture it is necessary therefore to consider alternative portfolios of industries.

The flexibility objective is attained through a diversity of different entries; it requires, therefore, a large number of entries in the portfolio. The other two major objectives exert an influence toward a small number of entries. The reasons are:

1. A large number of different entries entails an accumulation of entry costs which will depress profitability.

2. Once acquired, many distinct and different entries will cost more to operate because of a lack of synergy and dilution of management attention.

3. For many types of entry there is a minimum· critical mass below which the chances of success drop off quickly.

Critical mass is the market share which a firm must obtain in order to become fully competitive on price and cost.

Failure to make realistic estimates of the critical mass has been dramatically illustrated in the digital computer industry.

While critical mass is the minimum size of entry needed in order to be competitive, entries which are larger than critical mass" are to the firm's advantage, because of large volume and consequent stronger competitive position.

Since the overall size of the portfolio is limited by the total resources available for diversification (see internal appraisal, Chapter 8), the most attractive portfolios will be the result of a compromise between sizes of individual entries and their total number, subject to the critical mass constraint.

The set of portfolios defined and measured against objectives with the assistance of the growth vector is next ranked (5) on each major objective. The result is a list similar to the consolidated list, but containing portfolios for its entries, rather than for industries.

- WEIGHTING OF ALTERNATIVES
The stage is set for a major decision point at which the firm commits itself to a particular product-market scope and growth vector,

In practice this turns out to be a difficult process.

Each portfolio is measured by three ratings, one each in proximate, long-term, and flexibility objectives.

Each contributes to· a different aspect of the firm's performance; each is measured by a different yardstick; and an increase in one usually involves a decrease in the others.

- Note Loc. 2178  | Added on Saturday, January 31, 2015, 10:08 AM they are incommensurate and colinear.

This dilemma of reconciling non-commensurate and noncolinear objectives is not an issue in the behavioral theory of the firm.

There it is asserted that real-life firms do not· deal with multiple alternatives, but rather search for one alternative at a time.

While there is evidence (cited by Cyert and March) that some conservative firms do behave this way, there is also evidence that more progressive firms do not.

- Note Loc. 2184  | Added on Saturday, January 31, 2015, 10:11 AM references Cyert and March a lot.
it is our strong recommendation that firms should by all means take advantage of opportunities to select from multiple alternatives, even though the selection process may be complex and imprecise.

in the absence of some absolute standard (and business firms have few of these!), the value of a course of action can be more clearly perceived if it is viewed against the background of alternatives.

- Note Loc. 2188  | Added on Saturday, January 31, 2015, 10:12 AM interesting rule of thumb...
One helpful feature of our method of strategy formulation is the multi-stage process of narrowing of the field. of alternatives, which reduces the final list of portfolio scopes to a relatively small number, sometimes to a single acceptable alternative.

Another useful feature is the assignment of priorities to the respective objectives, since these can be used as 'weights' to compute an overall weighted rank 'for each of the remaining alternatives

It must be recognized, however, that different numerical weights may lead to different choices.

Several weighting schemes should be tried, therefore, and further subjected to consistency tests, such as the Churchman-Ackoff Test. [103]

- Note Loc. 2194  | Added on Saturday, January 31, 2015, 10:13 AM remember this test as a research methodological option.

frequently, several alternative 'best' choices will emerge depending on the weights.

while management science can offer help in clarifying choices, the final decision and the responsibility for it remain with the executive.

- ALLOWING FOR RISK AND UNCERTAINTY
The weighting procedures described above do not· resolve a problem which has a major influence on final choice. This is the problem of risk.

we shall use the word risk in a non-technical sense to denote the impact of imperfect information on decision making. As discussed earlier, in mathematical literature risk is a condition under which either the occurrence or the. outcome of a1ternatives is not certain but is assigned probabilities.

defn
Risk enters the problem in two ways.

First, we had to recognize at the outset that our ability to foresee the future in any detail is limited to only certain foreseeable events and that we have every reason to expect that other events, unforeseeable at present, have a high likelihood of occurring.

We sought to provide for unforeseeable events through the goals-threshold method for setting objectives and also through the flexibility objective.

However, the foreseeable events also contain several elements of risk.

the expectations of the firm's success in any given industry are at best probability judgments.

the projections of business conditions on which these expectations are based are themselves estimates of probable events.

the activities contemplated by the firm will impinge on those of other firms which may react through competition and try to minimize the effectiveness of our actions.

Thus the expectations from respective diversification prospects depend on three sources of uncertainty: uncertainties in estimation of results, uncertainties in projecting the environment, and uncertainties in competitive reaction.

there is a body of mathematics called game theory concerned with problems of competitive conflict.

game theory offers an extremely powerful and useful concept for analysis of strategic problems in which· .interaction among competitors has a strong influence on choice of strategy.

- RULES FOR DECISION
During the Appraisals the uncertainties of estimation and of prediction have been handled without an explicit recognition of probable errors in the estimates.

A 'most likely' environment was constructed and the 'most likely' performance ascribed to the firm.

consideration of risk must be introduced more explicitly.

There is another considerable body of mathematical literature, generally referred to as decision theory, which is concerned with decision making under imperfect information.lo5

Nevertheless, decision theory is useful as a 'truth and .consequence' device. By tracing the consequences of different risk-gain assumptions the decision maker can see what the resulting strategy would be under different principles of choice.

The aspiration level decision rule briefly referred to earlier, merely sets a minimum performance level required of an alternative. Alternatives which are below the level are rejected, those which equal or exceed it are accepted. The rule works' when one alternative is being examined. at a time. When several alternatives are being considered, the method has no way of discriminating among them.

The goals-threshold method, which we have introduced and discussed in detail in this book, is a step beyond the aspiration level. It rejects undesirable opportunities below the threshold, permits us to assess relative desirability of a single, opportunity by its place within the threshold-goal range; and permits comparison of several alternatives.

The most probable choice method, shown third, neglects the returns and deals with probabilities alone. It has merit when the probability of some particular environmental condition is much greater than that of all others.

A problem arises, however, when some low-probability event neglected in the' strategy has the potential of causing a complete disaster for the firm.

Thus, no provision for risk is made.

The expected value approach, (4) in the table, ·assumes that all decision l.l1akers balance risk versus gain in the same way and that they compare alternatives by the product of the returns and the probability of its occurrence.

Finally, the rating-probability exchange method differs from the expected value method in that the choice of an equivalent risk-returns combination is left to the decision· maker and is not assumed to be measured by the product of the two.

The expected value and the rating-probability exchange method both suffer from the deficiency that no course of action is rejected outright because it may contain a particularly unfavorable outcome.

in selecting its strategy the firm will probably want to reject alternatives which have a substantial probability of losing money, even though their expected value may be attractive. This kind of provision for risk can be made by application of simulation techniques.

It is seen from the preceding that the weighting; the game theory, arid the decision rules are addressed to complementary aspects of the problem.

The first deals with a combination of incommensurate yardsticks, the second with actions by competition, and the third with the uncertainties in the action outcomes and in behavior of the environment.

For the purpose of strategy selection, we recommend an approach which is a combination of weighting, game theory, goals-threshold rule, and expected value, or the rating-probability exchange rule. It would proceed as follows.

1. The threshold minimums are applied to reject alternatives which do not meet .the minimums established for each objective. This has a secondary effect of eliminating undesirable risks.

2. Wherever appropriate, the rating and hence relative rank of alternatives is reviewed and adjusted through the use of a game matrix which contains possible counter-strategies of competition.

3. Probability is assigned to each alternative for each objective. This is a combination probability which accounts for uncertainties of both estimation and forecasting.

The evaluation scheme proposed above is one of many similar ones which can be constructed.

In actual strategy selection, it will be useful to evaluate the alternatives in several different ways and to present to the decision maker the sensitivities of outcomes to different assumptions.

- COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
Beyond specifying the scope and the growth vector, it is to the firm's advantage to be on the lookout for individual opportunities within the scope which offer an unusual promise.

There are two ways in which such opportunities can be identified:.

1. in relation to characteristics of other products and markets

2. through the general characteristics of the competitive environment.

we have already identified some environmental characteristics which may make a new entry attractive to the firm. One of these is the cost of entry for a new competitor.

. Another characteristic which a firm may consciously seek is a favorable demand to-capacity relationship.

If the total capacity equals or exceeds demand, the competitive environment is due for a shakeout, even if the demand is growing.

outward evidence of slow growth may conceal a very attractive demand to capacity prospect.

A third characteristic which a firm may require in its entries is competitive dominance.

this may be attained by means of patent protection, cost of entry, or a dominant share of the market.

While potentially rewarding, search for competitive advantage through anticipating trends is also potentially expensive.

The search for a competitive advantage can be helped by a classification of product-market opportunities. Thus competing products can be classified into one of three following categories:

1. A breakthrough product which offers either a radical performance advantage over competition, a drastically lower price, or, in a highly desirable but unlikely situation, it may offer both.

2. A competitive product is one which shows no clear-cut advantage over other products. It is competitive in the sense that it represents a particular compromise of cost and performance characteristics.

3. An improved product which lies between the above two, while not radically different, can be shown to be clearly superior to others (usually better performance at competitive price, or lower price for same performance).

The characteristics of the demand for products can be similarly classified.

1. Established demand exists when a particular customer need has been previously serviced by existing products.

2. Under latent demand a group of potential customers is identified. The customers are aware of their needs, but no product has so far been offered to fill them.

3. Under incipient demand there is no awareness of need on the part of prospective customers; however, a trend .can be recognized which points toward emergence of future need.

- Note Loc. 2340  | Added on Sunday, February 01, 2015, 10:33 AM which category of competitive advantage is the ESOTI? which category of demand?

The important difference between types of demand lies in the cost of gaining acceptance for a new product.

Under existing demand acceptance is gained by proving superiority of the new product over others available. When this superiority appears self-evident, as with a breakthrough product, the cost is relatively low and competitive potential correspondingly high.

Under latent demand the customers need to be sold not on a relative asset but on the idea of the product.

Above all, they will need to be sold on the price.

Incipient demand requires the highest cost for customer acceptance. Two additional elements of cost must be considered. One is the cost of 'educating' the customer; the other, oddly enough, is the cost of finding the customers.

- Note Loc. 2347  | Added on Sunday, February 01, 2015, 10:35 AM this is what CSF is doing with SARG.

This cost has to be incurred on the embarrassingly frequent occasions when the engineering ,department of a firm invents what has been aptly called' a solution in search of a problem'-a product for which no specific group of customers has been identified.

The confidence level in whatever estimates are arrived at for incipient demand is the lowest of the three cases. The uncertainty in the 'estimates' of market size must now be compounded with the uncertainty of existence of the market in the first place.

- Note Loc. 2351  | Added on Sunday, February 01, 2015, 10:36 AM this is the problem with ESOTI demand forecast.

the three types of demand clearly imply very different timing for product introduction. The shortest delay is incurred under existing demand; the longest, in converting incipient to existing demand.

Table 9.3 is helpful in this analysis. The table offers a rough classification which matches productmarket types to the objectives they can best meet.

The breakthrough product is seen to contribute to the firm's flexibility.

The improved and competitive products may contribute to either the proximate or the long-term objectives, or to both, depending on the nature of the demand.

Generally speaking, in seeking breakthrough products the firm pursues the strongest possible competitive advantage.

the estimate of the advantage must be tempered by the higher costs of opening latent and particularly incipient markets.

Pursuit of these calls for a strategy of gradual resource commitment in order to take advantage of timing on the one hand and the natural evolution of markets on the other.

In some ways, anticipation of latent markets with existing or improved products (as in the case of G M and Sears mentioned above) appears to be the most attractive of all, since it takes advantage of astute timing and may not require a major financial exposure.

An attempt to open up incipient markets with improved or competitive products is the riskiest and potentially the most expensive course.

To summarize, the competitive advantage adds a dimension to strategy, both in search and in evaluation of opportunities.

really successful results require uncommon skills in anticipating trends in markets and in technology.

The ability to anticipate is greatly enhanced by acknowledge of the industry and its environment.

This is one reason why concentric diversification to related areas offers better opportunities for a competitive advantage than is offered by conglomerate diversification.

- SYNERGY, COMPONENT OF STRATEGY
A natural companion to the competitive advantage is the synergy component of strategy.

the firm's competence profile is superimposed on top of the competitive' profile of the product-market scope (or some part of it).

The areas of reinforcement show areas of potential synergy described in terms of individual skills, specialized facilities, organizational or management skills.

In constructing and comparing the profiles it is important to avoid mistaking an abundant competence for an outstanding one.

A classic example of such confusion was provided by the aircraft industry after World War II, when many of its members sought to diversify into a variety of products fabricated of aluminum. In retrospect this strategy appears to have been wrong in two ways.

First, the specialized organizational structure of the aircraft industry, with attendant high overhead and labor costs precluded it from being competitive in industrial and consumer aluminum fabrication.

Secondly, the fabrication competence was not a critical success ingredient in most applications which were attempted.

In consumer applications (skis, canoes) merchandising was the skill; in industrial applications (self-powered wheelbarrows) trouble-free continuous operation under poor maintenance and abuse was required. Interestingly enough, one venture which appears to have succeeded was a high-quality, high margin item marketed under very special conditions (aluminum coffins).

Another possible confusion to be avoided is the use of the same terminology in different industries to describe activities which are not necessarily identical.

the claim is often made that this 'systems management skill' is applicable to the large industrial projects. While this may be true in some instances, the mere use of identical terms does not guarantee complete similarity.

The synergy component and competitive advantage need to be made compatible; ideally, one should be an extension of the other. Unless this is done, they may cancel each other.

choice of product-market scope and of growth vector (6), of synergy (7), and of competitive advantage component (8) of strategy complete the job of strategy formulation, except for the decision on the method of growth.

- ACQUISITION VERSUS INTERNAL GROWTH -THE MAKE OR BUY DECISION
The process of strategy selection was carried out in broad terms without reference to whether the firm will grow by acquisition or develop from within.

Both .acquisition and interI1al development assume many forms. The former varies from licensing, to purchase of developed products, to mergers with another firm; the latter, from addition of new products to major organizational changes to make room for new skills and competences.

Two primary variables influence the choice between the major alternatives.

These are the start-up cost and the timing.

In internal development the costs are incurred by product development and introduction, and by acquisition of new facilities and organizations. Acquisition pays for these costs too; however, over and above them is a premium which frequently has to be paid as a compensation for the risks which had been taken by the seller to develop the property and the competences being sold.

Because of this premium, it is sometimes argued that internal development is cheaper.

In some cases the choice between acquisition and internal development is forced in favor of the latter. This will occur when· the current price/earnings ratio in the new industry is much higher than that of the firm itself.

In internal development the timing of entry consists of two elements.

1. The normal product development cycle. This may vary from six months to four years depending on technological and marketing complexity of the product.

2. The time span required to acquire new skills and competence. This can vary from one to five or six years.

In acquisition of a firm the delay is theoretically only as long as the time to consummate the transaction. In practice a time delay is added during which the acquisition is introduced into the parent organization.

it generally takes much longer to develop than to acquire a firm.

The pros and cons of acquisition versus internal development can be related to the components of synergy, as shown in Table 9.4. TABLE 9.4 Internal Development versus Acquisition

internal development is indicated when the start-up synergy is strong, even if operating synergy is weak.

Exceptions in favor of acquisition may occur

1. when the needs of the firm or instability of the market make a quick entry important,

2. when the firm needs or is offered opportunity to acquire competent management,

3. when the firm will have to enlarge some of its capacities anyway,

4. when a product developed outside the firm costs less than it would to develop internally, [ooo] and

5. as mentioned above, when the market shares in the new industry are stabilized, making it very difficult for a newcomer to take away business from established competitors

Weak start-up synergy generally makes acquisition preferable.

.if opening synergy is strong -indicating applicable unused, although not critical, capacities -a combination of acquisition and internal development is indicated.

Absence of synergy points to acquisition in most cases. An exception is a situation when the premium on timing is low.

The middle column in the table relates the method of expansion to the growth vector. The high synergy strategies will usually be pursued through internal development.

Conglomerate diversification usually calls for acquisition.

- SUMMARY
Figure 9.2, which presents the overall decision .flow in product-market strategy formulation by bringing together and inter-connecting the partial decision flow stages of earlier chapters.

Another characteristic of the adaptive search method was described as the 'open-ended constraint' property.

Objectives are tentatively selected at the outset and then revised twice during the internal appraisal

They are further reviewed at the point of final diversification decision

we had listed in Chapter 2 some imperatives which must be met by a practical theory of strategic decisions.

1. Include all four, rather than the last two steps of the generalized problem-solving sequence.

2. Handle allocation of the firm's resources between opportunities in hand and probable future opportunities under conditions of partial ignorance.

3. Evaluate joint effects (synergy) resulting from addition of new product-markets to the firm.

4. Single out opportunities with outstanding competitive advantages.

5. Handle a vector of potentially antagonistic objectives.

6. Evaluate long-term potential of projects even though cash flow projections are unreliable.

Although requirement 2., provision for partial ignorance, is not immediately apparent from the diagram, it has conditioned both the theoretical structure and the methodology of the· entire approach.

Requirement 3, provision for joint effects, is also a determining influence in the problem structure.

The last two requirements, accommodation to a vector of objectives and provision for measuring the' unmeasurable' long-term effects; have been handled through the hierarchy of objectives and through the final alternative selection method

Our final result is what may be called 'a theory of strategic decisions '. It is built on a series of concepts: objectives (attributes, priorities, and goals), strategy (product-market scope, growth vector, synergy, competitive advantage), present position (measured by forecasts), capabilities (measured by the competence profile), potential (measured by economic potential, cost of entry, and competitive profiles), and synergy (measured by superposition of profiles).

Strategy is viewed as an 'operator' which is designed to transform the firm from the present position to the position described by the objectives, subject to the constraints of the capabilities and the potential.

defn
In one sense our formulation falls short of normal requirements of a theory: we do not at this point have unambiguous decision rules at each decision point, which, for example, would make it possible to program the strategy selection process on a computer.

If our strategic decision theory were to be compared with others, we suggest that it is a behavioral theory; since it deals with decisions by individuals within, an organization.

It also has strong economic overtones; since we assert that the firm's behavior is profit-oriented, and that institutional characteristics of the firm are dominant in this behavior, though perturbed and affected by the individual participants.

## CHAPTER 10. Uses of Strategy
- THE PROBLEM
Two tasks remain. The first is to develop a procedure for individual project evaluation and selection.

The second is to show how strategy can be used within the overall periodic planning process of the business firm.

- AN OVERVIEW
 
Figure 10.1, which shows only the main building blocks.

The trigger signal which starts strategic analysis may come about in one of several ways depending on the circumstances of the firm' and the far-sightedness of its management.

Generally speaking, firms can be divided into three categories: 1. ‘reactors' which wait for problems to occur before attempting to solve them, 2. 'planners' which anticipate problems, and 3. 'entrepreneurs' which anticipate both problems and opportunities.

The immediate reaction to a trigger is to make explicit and/or to review the objectives (1) of the firm.

Real-world business objectives have two characteristics which exert a major influence on the entire process of strategy formulation.

The first is that there is not a single objective but rather a vector of objectives, each of which makes competing claims on the resources of the firm.

The second is that the threshold-goal values and priorities cannot be set arbitrarily, but must be adjusted in the light of the capabilities and the opportunities of the firm.

Following the initial formulation of objectives, internal" appraisal (2) is initiated.

The outcome of internal appraisal is a specification of the improvement in performance (the expansion gap) which the firm will strive for allocation of resources to this program, determination of need for diversification (diversification gap), and determination of resources which will be available for this purpose.

The external appraisal (3), which follows, seeks to determine and analyze the field of outside opportunities open to the firm.

Because of partial ignorance, external appraisal does not attempt to deal with individual firms and products. Instead, the analysis is on the level of industries and groups of industries as a preliminary to a later specification of decision and rules (strategy) which the firm will use in its search for individual opportunities.

another major management decision is' made. This is whether and to what extent the firm will vary its organizational structure and other administrative arrangements in order to take advantage of the joint-effects (synergy) potential

Up to this point the analysis consists of ranking opportunities and screening out undesirable or inefficient ones. The result is a number of lists ranked on the respective objectives of the firm.

A major and difficult step is now taken of constructing several alternative product-market scopes (portfolios) into which the firm can afford to diversify and ranking these in the order of overall preference.

The final choice is somewhat cumbersome, because it must attempt to provide for a , variety of uncertainties and risks which underlie the evaluation of industries.

Following the choice of product-market scope, additional components of strategy are selected: the growth vector, the competitive advantage, and the synergy component.

This component selection process proceeds in parallel for the· diversification (5) and the expansion (6) substrategy.

At the termination the two are added up to produce the: total product-market strategy of the firm.

Before this can be implemented several important steps and decisions must be taken. The first is a make or buy decision on the preferred method of· growth and expansion.

Secondly, an administrative strategy (7) must be formulated to establish rules for the organizational evolution of the firm.

Thirdly, a financial strategy (8) is needed which will specify the rules and means by which the firm will seek to finance growth and expansion.

both the finance and the administrative strategy are influenced by, and in turn influence, the product-market strategy.

- PROJECT EVALUATION
evaluation of product-market opportunities differs· from evaluation of capital investment projects. There are two major points of difference.

1. Because of conditions of partial ignorance, product-market projects cannot all be examined at the same time, but have to be evaluated in a continual stream.

This evaluation has to take account of: a. The present product-market position. b. The projects currently under way. c. Other projects which are being held in reserve against availability of resources·. d. Potential future projects which may develop within the budgeting period.

2. Because of the multi-dimensional character of objectives and because of shortcomings of measurement and forecasting, evaluation of a project cannot be based solely on a net cash-flow measurement.

Other measurements must be added in order to make sure that the opportunity: a. Meets the objectives. b. Fits in with the firm's strategy. c. Is assessed accurately enough to provide for effects not measured by cash flows.

we can now construct a method for project evaluation which satisfies all of these requirements.

The decision flow in project evaluation is divided into three main parts: 1. screening, 2. preliminary evaluation, and 3. final evaluation.

The first step in screening is to subject the opportunities to the threshold-goals (1) test

An opportunity which is below the threshold on all of the major dimensions of the objectives is rejected.

If it exceeds one of the major goals, it is retained for future study,

If the opportunity lies within threshold-goals range, it is subjected to three successive screenings to determine its fit within the growth vector (2), its compliance with the competitive advantage (3), and the synergy (4) strategy components.

Two screening steps follow -one against the finance strategy (5), and the other against the administrative strategy (6).

Preliminary evaluation, similarly to the external appraisal (see Chapter 7), measures the opportunity against economic (7), cost .0/entry (8), and synergy potential (9) criteria.

The three criteria ratings are now combined into an overall project evaluation (11) with respect to the objectives.

this is a twofold combined' evaluation: 1. Of the merits of the opportunity. 2. Of its relative scarcity.

it does not include a comparison with the other projects of the firm.

a portfolio fit (12). This stacks the new project against 'the following:

1. The present product-market posture of the firm. ,2. The list of currently active product-market acquisitions and development projects. 3. The list of projects not currently active, but which had previously been evaluated, found acceptable and put 'on the shelf' to await availability of manpower, and other resources. 4. The product-market plan of the firm in the area of the present project.

This comparison leads to one of the following conclusions:

1. Reject the project, because it overlaps with and is not superior to another project already on the books. 2. Provisionally accept the project for implementation. 3. Add it to the reserve list of approved projects. 4. Remove a project on the reserve list and replace it with the same project. 5. Remove an active project -discontinue it and provisionally accept the present project.

If a project is provisionally accepted, it is next screened to determine whether further evaluation is necessary before proceeding with a project plan and with implementation.

The screening is on four variables:

1. Project Size
2. Risk
3. Total Size
4. Strategy Fit
Final evaluation consists of determining future cash flows, investment patterns, and profitability characteristics of the product-market position implied by the project.

Another and equally important role of strategy is in the overall periodic planning process of the firm.

beyond this, strategy is a key to the overall behavior of the firm in its resource acquisition, allocation, and conversion processes.

- A TOTAL PLANNING FRAMEWORK
Business planning has been defined in many ways. Perhaps the most comprehensive and descriptive definition was given by Peter Drucker. He defines business planning as a continuous process of making present entrepreneurial decisions systematically and with best possible knowledge of their futurity, organizing systematically the effort needed to carry out these decisions, and measuring the results of" these decisions against expectations through organized systematic feedback. [111]

defn
The definition is in three parts: 1. Making decisions systematically. 2. Preparing programmes for their implementation. 3. Measuring actual performance against the programmes.

To extend our results to Drucker's definition of a plan we need to construct a document which will 'organize systematically the effort' for carrying out the decision. We shall call such document a strategic budget.

We further define a budget as a time-phased schedule for implementation of decisions.

defn
It consists of a performance budget, which is a schedule of actions to be taken and milestones to be attained, and of a resource budget, which is a time schedule of resource commitments (in terms of money, people, facilities, and equity) in support of the performance. A third important part of the budget is a forecast of the results which will be achieved, expressed preferably in terms of a profit and loss forecast and a pro forma balance sheet. ... This might be called a profit budget.

defns
If Drucker's definition of planning and our corresponding definition of the .strategic plan are compared with common business practice, a substantial difference would be observed. A majority of business plans consists of what we have defined as budgets, without any evidence of the decision analysis required in the first part of Drucker's definition.

an analysis of alternative strategies and policies which leads to the preferred decisions. An estimate is useful beyond just being a historical record. As Drucker suggests, the third element of planning is a comparison of the actual results with the forecasts.

use of the comparisons for improvement of future planning: improvement in the assumptions, techniques, logic of analysis, search for alternatives, and decision rules.

The difference between common 'business practice and our definition is further found in the fact that most firms do not prepare a strategic plan which analyses and programmes what we have called strategic 'decisions.

The preceding comments suggest that most firms need to broaden their planning frameworks in two ways: 1. Through addition or a strategic plan to their system of plans. 2. Through appending a decision analysis to the budgets in each of the plans.

The general framework of a business plan would then look as shown in Figure 10.3.

The strategic plan is the key document which gives guidance and allocates resources among the major activities of the firm.

This is elaborated in three subordinate plans: a detailed plan for product-market change (productmarket development plan), a plan for structure and acquisition of resources (resource-development plan), and a plan for day-to-day running of the firm (operating plan).

in order to make planning an effective tool of management, the responsibility and the authority for respective budgets should be unambiguously assigned to specific managers.

We have described total business planning only to the extenf needed to relate strategy formulation to the larger framework.
